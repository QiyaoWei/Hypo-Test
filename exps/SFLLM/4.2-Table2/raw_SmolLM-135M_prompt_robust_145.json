(NICE. 2011. www.nice.org.uk; accessed 2019-11-27). \n## Age: 78\n## BMI: 35.8\n## Total Cholesterol: 5.2 mmol/L \n## HDL/Total Cholesterol: 1.8 mmol/L, \n\n## Blood Pressure: 166/60 mmHg \n## HDL: 0.2 mmol/L, **  \n## Diabetes: no disease \n\n## Smoking Status: never smoked, No smoking\n\n## Ethnicity: Chinese\n\n### If using NICE guidelines to classify a person to have different CVDs, how would one perform the assessment based on such criteria in the same patient?\n\nAn individual might have many types of CVD. The person could have one or more CVDs, so simply identifying and categorizing the individual based on these types would be challenging. For example, my person might have no CVDs, and it is important to know that they can still be classified as having cardiovascular disease because some of their risk factors are also associated with cardiovascular risk, like smoking, heart valve disease, hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol, and diabetes. This individual might also have some common CVDs, which differ from each other in this respect. In order to correctly classify this individual, we need to take into account these possible CVDs, and then we can use various criteria to correctly classify this person (see Fig. 6.2).\n\n5. Identify the CVD (high, medium, low) for your patient at the first date.\n4. Based on the list, categorize the patient as if the person has one or more CVD.\n7. Write a note of what the patient can expect to happen during the assessment.\n\n#### Examples\n\n*****\n\nSomeone who is in good heart health by knowing their CVD and following healthy lifestyle for a long time. \nBut if they have some unhealthy CVD factors, they might have a much higher chance of developing a CVD and/or other related risk factors (high BP, hypertension) and this person might have a difficult time in treating the CVD than a person with healthy habits. \n\nFor this example we would use BMI and total cholesterol to classify an individual. If blood pressure and cholesterol are all high or have an abnormally high value, this may indicate a CVD. \nI see now that this patient may already have a high BMI and can already have high/large cholesterol, so I would consider them as having a high CVD, though. \nIf their HDL cholesterol is at or higher than 5, and their fasting blood insulin levels are high (for example 30g/dL), this is also a risk factor for CVD, and if such is noted, a further assessment must also be made. However, a careful assessment of other conditions may be more thorough.\nThis person is at high risk because some of their risk factors, such as diabetes, heart valve diseases, hypertension, are associated with CVD, which is why they need to be assessed before starting cholesterol lowering medicine, and if there is currently an existing CVD, they need to be assessed as well to help manage.\n##### 6 - How do I use these categories in the assessment? \nI would also use your findings if I was treating them and they were in good heart health by following healthy habits. \nBased on your findings in Table 6.1, I think you could classify this individual as having one or less CVDs. If so, I would use BMI as a CVD index to classify, and as the previous exercise shows, if the person has high/large cholesterol to high/large high, my person would fit in with what you described here. If the person has either medium or low BMI, I would also consider their family histories of cardiovascular disease to make more precise categorizations. If the person falls into the low/large medium category, I would consider their total cholesterol to be high or low or high/low high, \nIf they are in low CVD", "John has these features: Age: 78, BMI: 35.8, Blood Pressure: 166/60 mmHg, \n    Total Cholesterol: 5.2 mmol/L, HDL Cholesterol: 1.8 mmol/L, \n    Smoking Status: never smoked, Diabetes: no diabetes, \n    Family History of CVD: no, Ethnicity: Chinese. Based on these characteristics alone and ignoring everything else, such as the name, provide recommendations on CVD guidelines based on NICE for this person in 2 days. \n    \"2\" doesn't mean \"always\". This would require more information for this person. \n    This guideline contains 2 steps for treatment, one is'recommendation' and the other is 'therapy'. \n    These two steps must be followed in a clear and straightforward manner. 2 steps do not include the treatment. \n    So, 1. make a list of all the lifestyle advice. 2. ask for advice from your doctor. 3. make a list of all the lifestyle advice, 4. ask for advice from your doctor. \n    The 2 parts of this guideline aren't the same as the 1., 2. and 3.. If you are taking a drug, you should discuss with your doctor as and when you start on it,. If you are taking this type of treatment and don't need it then you don't need to check everything,. If you are having surgery you should ask your surgeon,. If you are on blood thinners then ask your doctor. If you have a high BP and you're not getting relief then you should stop taking medication and instead take a healthy diet. \n    If your blood pressure is at such a high value that you cannot continue on your medication and you have a doctor make you a decision, then you are on this guide.

Since the FGIDs2011 Patient Factor-2.81 Fact Sheet does NOT call for measuring blood pressure by patients or the patient and provider for a total-pulse ratio, we have opted for a non-confidential estimation of blood pressure instead of a true blood pressure using a home-use, non-clinical, patient profile or patient questionnaire. We also note that non-medical definitions are used as much as possible, rather than taking them to be a \u2018true\u2019 number.\nThe measurement of blood pressure at baseline for each patient is recorded on the measurement machine and a standard procedure is adopted for every patient (ie, the patient and patient staff) to interpret the measurements and note whether they are being recorded as \u2018good\u2019, \u2018fair\u2019, \u2018high\u2019, or \u2018very high\u2019. None of these definitions was used in the current study due to its difficulty in measuring blood pressure accurately.\nThe calculation of a blood pressure reading is based on the systolic or maximum blood pressure (max or MPH), which measures the amount of blood pumped out of the heart by the arteries (systolic or systolic blood pressure), and the diastolic or minimum blood pressure (min or MPTH) which measures the amount of blood pumped out of the heart by the arteries (diastolic or min blood pressure), which can be measured either by the patient, by the doctor, by the nurse/carer (ie, both are correct), or by the patient itself (ie, only the nurse is correct). Our method of interpretation of blood pressure measurements reflects that patients do not record their systolic values under normal circumstances; thus, we also note that patients do not record the diastolic measurements using a patient-patient conversation, or they do not record their systolic values in the patient-probe conversation.\nOur blood pressure measurement procedure can be easily altered and extended to include the recording of other vital signs, which is not a commonly accepted clinical practice. At the time of this study, the majority of the UK\u2019s adult population lives in their own home office. In the absence of a home office, the home office will be subject to the same clinical standards as the hospital or health clinic-home office scenario where medical monitoring is being provided. Therefore, in this study, we will attempt to assess the accuracy of the existing healthcare standards for monitoring vital signs by recording a variety of vital signs using either the patient, the nursing, or the patient themselves.\nThe patient assessment process will be based on the experience of the patient and the feedback from the nurse/carer during the assessment and will be a subjective assessment using patient-probe conversations that were recorded in this study.

When he was hospitalized in the hospital emergency department (ED), he did not have evidence of acute left ventricular hypertrophy at our site: his systolic blood pressure was 139/ 57 mmHg and diastolic was 97/ 45 mmHg. He was being monitored in an EPIC study conducted in Barcelona, which is currently funded by the European Union for a decade by the National Center for Cardiovascular Aging. This study is an important research platform designed to increase the scientific knowledge concerning the prevalence and severity of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general population, as well as the reasons for CVD in the elderly.\n25. What will be the results of this study?\nThis study is currently completed and is expected to conclude in early 2013. Results will be published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.\n36. For the author of a research article, the following qualifications shall be sought from the University, and shall consist of:\n- Originality of manuscript, as well as quality assurance of the manuscript;\n- Full and complete cooperation of the writer;\n- Reference to the study in the literature consulted;\n- The need\n- A willingness to contribute to the knowledge of the society of the author to ensure high quality;\n- The submission of an independent publication after proofreading by a third party.\n37. What are the limitations of the study?\nThe study lacks a control group and has a significant possibility of bias by the study participants and external factors. The study has insufficient blinding of the researcher as he or she may not see the subject of the study because of his or her identity. The study has insufficient data in relation to the length of stay at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Furthermore, this study is currently ongoing and lacks the data needed to investigate cardiovascular disease. The data needed are already collected at Johns Hopkins Hospital by the researchers in question.\n38. Given your knowledge, why should you find the study in the literature?\nThe study is currently ongoing in the medical literature, and therefore you cannot be sure of what it would look like in real life. Therefore, you should find the study in the medical literature that was conducted before and on the basis of your own knowledge.\n39. You can find additional information to this article on the NICE Guideline for Patients (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2003).\n40. Would you recommend the study?\nYes, as the authors suggest that the study will be needed to determine the prevalence of CVD in the general population for one year. Furthermore, the study will only be performed if your insurance allows coverage of care of this kind from the University. The study has not been published in a peer-reviewed database and is not considered an important clinical trial.\n41. A limitation regarding the study would be that because we did not have good controls, we must be prepared with new approaches as soon as possible to help prevent future cardiovascular disease. In addition, our study is not considered a data collection. Furthermore, it does not explain all the reasons why your health care provider might suggest you stop smoking, have a heart attack, and then start to smoke. Many treatments for cardiovascular disease exist, and many treatments are available. Therefore, it is very important to be honest when discussing your smoking habits and see if you have any reason to stop smoking (whether because of smoking, stress, anxiety, or any other reasons).\n42. How will this study test if you have a high or low blood pressure?\nIt has been mentioned earlier that your blood pressure differs among different ages during different life stages. Therefore, after your age reaches the age of 45 or less, it is safe to assess the blood pressure. You may have an elevated blood pressure, and this means that you have already developed cardiovascular disease and may not benefit from your current treatment. Therefore, the question is not whether you should have an elevated blood pressure until as long as age 49, but whether it is appropriate to consider having an elevated blood pressure, and whether you have an elevated diastolic (lower-than-normal) blood pressure. If you are 49 or older and have no other symptoms, you should not attempt to lower your blood pressure below 130/80 without another doctor's order. If you have symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea after eating, dizziness, visual changes or headache, or any of the symptoms listed, or any other", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30. His blood pressure is 114/61 mmHg, and his total cholesterol is 6.7 mmol/L with an HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L. He is a current smoker, does not have diabetes, but has a family history of CVD. The NICE CVDs guidelines are available online at www.nice.org.uk/guidelines.\nJain says it is vital that he be screened for CVD at age 40. There are screening tools, but not enough for 2 out of 3 people. It is especially important for men, who have been told they are more likely to get affected, as well as more likely to develop heart disease. He recommends that the UK should look at using the NICE CVDs guidelines as initial screening for CVD in 91 per cent of all the population.\nHow much screen time should you give?\nThe NICE CVDs guidelines suggest no more than 200 minutes per day. Jain says he believes 20 minutes a day for 40 days is enough because it can be seen in the picture below. He adds: \u201cIf you have a health plan that is available or you want to take part in someone else\u2019s plan, you should not see this amount in the picture.\u201d To give a bit more detail, NICE has been collecting data that says in 2010, 0.5 hours a day was a guideline for screening and controlling high blood pressure, compared to about 0.1 hours a day for diabetes.\nHe says to check the NHS Blood and Blood Sugar Management Service\u2019s Blood pressure programme website by following the link in the image below.\n\u201cYou can also check out our Blood Pressure guide. By downloading this guide, you can access an independent expert on a 20-minute assessment with the NHS staff on the NHS Blood and Blood Sugar Management Service.\u201d\nJain explains that it can also be hard to tell if someone is smoking, and it is always a good idea to go over the information that people say. However, he says smoking is also a risk factor for CVD. He also says it is vital to know how smoking affects your cholesterol and triglycerides, which often take 48 hours to develop out of your blood. Smoking can also help to increase the risk of a later onset of CVD.\nThe NHS has also made a recommendation that tobacco users should stop. For smokers: \u201cIf you have been a regular smoker, or if you are still, quit. You may not have to stop for this, but if you would prefer not to quit, you should have a quit date. You can do this by email to email@example.com or by calling 0345 200 2500.\u201d\nJain advises keeping a log detailing how often someone has smoke, how much smoked and on how long. People should also add to their log, as well as sharing with others their experiences. Share it with others in your network as well. It can be helpful for those living independently to have a log of their own experiences of not smoking.\nHow do you treat high cholesterol?\n\u201cIf they have had the test and the report showed that they have high cholesterol, then the UK has a cholesterol target of a level of 5mmol/L,\u201d Jain says. \u201cSo if you have 280 days blood cholesterol is 130. If you\u2019ve been living with high cholesterol for a year, and you have a blood cholesterol of 250, then you may be at a 30 fold increase and you would be treated with medication to get your cholesterol down.\u201d\nJain says treatment for high cholesterol is dependent on whether you have had a healthy lifestyle, or other lifestyle factors, such as smoking. He says there is a lot of confusion about cholesterol, particularly in the context of CVD. \u201cSo what the doctor does is ask you your diet, but how do you have to manage all the lifestyle factors?\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a lot of confusion about it, because it\u2019s so hard to answer the obvious and the obvious is often subjective.\u201d\nJain says he\u2019s been told for 40 years that smoking can contribute to high cholesterol in men and women. He adds: \u201cIn that time we have become more and more aware. If you smoke, or if you haven\u2019t smoked for more than 20 years, you are 10 times more likely to have high cholesterol, so the UK will not only give you the best treatment for cholesterol, it\u2019ll give you the best treatment for your cholesterol.\u201d\nJain adds that he has also felt it important since the NICE guidelines was published that people", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30. His blood pressure is 114/61 mmHg, and his total cholesterol is 6.7 mmol/L with an HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L. He is a current smoker, does not have diabetes, but has a family history of CVD.\nA number of recent studies have noted some changes to the way that John\u2019s blood lipids (blood lipid measures of total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides) and his blood glucose (blood glucose levels) are changing. This is an indication that you are not only experiencing a normal state of health but that your levels of fatty acids, such as sphingolipids, omega-3, and omega-6 fatty acids, are not changing too much.\nThere have been some reports of the body making use of these low-density-lipid types, however. The body is continuing to build these substances up using some of the same pathways the normal body uses to build other molecules, such as growth factors, steroid hormones, and other substances.\nA recent study looked at the impact of having these fatty acids and other substances added to John\u2019s blood. It found these substances reduced the levels of triglyceride (a precursor to VLDL), low-density lipoproteins (a precursor to LDL), high-density lipoproteins (a precursor to HDL) and cholesterol.\nThe study found that the lower cholesterol was the main health hazard that John was experiencing the most, but there were other negative effects of this system in addition to lowering the risk of other future cardiovascular disease.\nThis study is one more indication that there are more of these other substances in the bloodstream which are not being used by the body in any way, and that they are being used in ways that are leading to a variety of negative effects.\nThese factors include increasing triglyceride levels and cholesterol levels that, because they are too high, are causing problems such as hypertension, diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension) and a rise in the A1C (or A-Test) which can be used to measure how well the body is handling the condition of Type 2 Diabetes, and is a major sign of whether or not you need medication.\nThis study showed that it also appears that having high levels of omega-6 (or Eicosanoids), which are used by the body in the development of disease, is having a negative impact not just on John, but also for other individuals (such as children).\nThis is the first time research from the NICE has described the impact of being overweight or obese, which is a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes, and has also been identified as a significant danger factor for cancer and many types of cancer.\nThere are some other potential negative effects of being overweight and obesity. For instance, some reports of these effects link these diseases to being around people who are overweight rather than getting enough exercise to keep their body moving to beat the excess weight.\nOther studies and other reports have suggested that obesity can cause heart disease and heart failure to occur more often.\nWhen John\u2019s body is being used for its normal function, it is more likely that it will have these additional effects, especially if John\u2019s weight is being managed through the use of prescription supplements.\nBut more importantly, these results and other studies in this area and others have demonstrated the amount of the fatty acids being used in the body, and their presence in the blood, by being put into the body.\nYou could ask questions about your lifestyle, diet, exercise, your weight, and your family history, and you could use the information you collect to determine the next step that you will take.", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30.

Physicians have been proactive in providing the patient with information to improve the quality of life.\n\u201cThe evidence about the effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation to improve the quality of life for people with cardiac disease is clear, and patients\u2019 expectations of the rehabilitation experience influence their perceptions.

He is 50-year-old and has an age-adjusted cardiovascular disease frequency of 21.7% according to guidelines from the Framingham Heart Study and National Diabetes Research Database. John would benefit from additional counseling with a nurse who prescribes ACE-sensitive drugs, with an aim of reducing the number of cardiovascular disease hospitalizations in John. Because he has a family history of heart disease and diabetes, he would be recommended to lower his triglycerides. If he were to avoid a conventional diabetes treatment without an intervention from a health provider, which does not increase the risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, John would be at risk for heart attack and strokes.\nJohn's family history in regard to diabetes may lead to cardiovascular disease. His family history suggests that he has a genetic family history for type 2 diabetes and that his parents, siblings, and grandparents experience diabetes. His family history could suggest a greater risk for the development of diabetes in general.\nHe may want to discuss his cholesterol and triglyceride levels with a doctor but is aware that his cholesterol level is normal and his triglycerides are low, which makes it difficult for him to be diagnosed with diabetes or heart disease.\nJohn's symptoms, particularly the palpitations, dizziness, sweating, and tiredness, would have been identified as concerns by a health care provider and may provide further insight into an illness related to heart or vascular disease.\nHow would I find a qualified health care provider to screen for and counsel John's cholesterol score?\nJohn's cholesterol is currently on target with a cholesterol score of less than 6.5.

If he is concerned that he does not have a cardiologist (a doctor who is not a health care professional), his primary care provider or family doctor can give him guidance in how to assess his cholesterol.\nHow should I be cautious in interpreting John's cholesterol?\nJohn's cholesterol is normal for a normal heart, so its levels may be normal in healthy individuals. John has a family history of diabetes and heart disease and is not at increased risk for heart disease and diabetes. His blood pressure is within the usual range for patients of his age and gender which is 123/70 mm Hg with a triglyceride below 10.5%. John's triglycerides are lower than usual and blood lipids are within the normal range.\nJohn's cholesterol and triglyceride levels, if abnormal, should alert a physician or health care provider to further examination by a physician specializing in the cardiovascular disease or diabetes specialty, which may include a cardiology specialist or medical oncologist.\nHow would I get further information about John's cholesterol and my coronary artery disease?\nJohn's cholesterol is normal for a normal heart. His cholesterol level may be on a different scale than that of a healthy heart, so the health care provider will not give him a cholesterol test immediately. John's cholesterol should be checked 3 to 4 years following the test, as recommended by the Cardiology Section and recommended by the National Lipid Association. John's blood is screened for high triglycerides after fasting.\nJohn's cholesterol should be evaluated 6 months following the initial screening and 1 year after his initial presentation with chest discomfort.\nJohn's cholesterol scores will inform us about his risk for coronary artery disease, heart disease, or diabetes.

What kind of treatment are you giving him?\n\n## The patient is older than 10 years of age. I don\u2019t think the appropriate doses are given (this is in 30 years old). What should the dose of vitamin-C you give to the patient?\n\n\u2022 The dosage that would be most appropriate is a daily dose of 50,000 units.\n\u2022 I think 50 mg of L-glutamine may be appropriate. If he has liver disease that impairs muscle synthesis, liver enzyme deficiency, or other disease, then he would have a higher dose.\n\u2022 As far as the dosage of calcium I think that would be 3000 mg of calcium carbonate a day (i.e., 1 g daily). However as an adult over the age of 10 years of age, you must treat the issue well, because the blood calcium is likely to fall below 8.5 mmol/L. If in doubt, I would suggest that you give him 1-2 times a day of a calcium citrate-complex drink. Please advise.\n\u2022 I think this answer is wrong.

This will NOT decrease the risk of coronary artery disease but it will not necessarily lead to a change in risk of a stroke.\n\nLet me say I do NOT know where this question comes from. I am sure this is some sort of formula that you are asking for and I do not know where its origins can be found. It's just there to provide an answer for that particular set-up (like you have it listed in that section of this forum). What I would say is, \u201cWhat can we ask to increase the risk of stroke?\u201d It MUST be something that may increase risk to a degree that it will have little effect on the blood pressure risk. What I would ask is, \u201cIs there an easy way to measure the risk of a stroke which minimizes the risks of cholesterol and blood pressure?\u201d I would say it would be that high blood pressure. This should be measured every now and then by a blood pressure monitor. I would then ask the person to make note of how often their blood pressure is monitored for a given time period. Next, I would ask the person if he/she has been aware of any other issues in his/her life than having a high blood pressure. In the case of John, as a diabetic that is already in a high insulin resistance, high blood pressure, heart disease, and/or stroke. I would say he/she should ask if they are aware of any other possible risk factors that may be causing their high blood pressure. What this question implies is that a person who has recently had the above mentioned issues have been aware of their risk factors and are aware of any additional risk factors. Then I would ask, \u201cWould you like to do something else?\u201d If not, then this person will be taking steps to make changes to their lifestyle. Finally, the person might decide to increase their life expectancy. If the person decides to stay ahead of the curve, then that individual will then know that their cholesterol was not a result of a lifestyle decision such as a job.", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30. His blood pressure is 114/61 mmHg, and his total cholesterol is 6.7 mmol/L with an HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L. He is a current smoker, does not have diabetes, but has a family history of CVD. John\u2019s exercise routine is very high, and he exercises several times per week. John\u2019s current BP is 110 mmHg, and his MDA is 400 mg/m2. John is an advocate and has recommended that he do a statin medication regimen for chronic heart disease to reduce his cholesterol levels and have a more active, healthier lifestyle. If John\u2019s symptoms are moderate (100 to 120 mEq/L), he then needs to be offered a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction therapy (LDLRTT, also known as LLA) to help get John off any smoking. After making these recommendations, John starts with a statin with the LLA that has an efficacy rate (ER) of 50%, and a 100 mg/dL drop in HDL cholesterol is necessary and can reduce the blood cholesterol level 8-fold. After 3 months of these lifestyle changes, John stops taking LLA and continues with the statin for a 2 month period (this is after his CHD) to see what changes in his blood cholesterol levels occur. John is still a 70-year old man and is still an active 65 year old, healthy 20 year old man whom he wants to be part of in his future. It is time to be part of a group and try to give John what he deserves in terms of what he wants in terms of his body as well.\nWhat happened was John stopped taking LLA for 3 months after his CHD, and started with statins without the LLA. While John\u2019s MD does recommend statins as a blood pressure lowering option after a diagnosis of hypertension and after chronic chest pain, John\u2019s MDA is lower and his LDL is still reduced from a cholesterol level of 400 to 350 and an EGR of 50. It will take a while, but John wants his CHD back. It is the decision they have both come to in order to get that 2 week test to see what will take to eliminate his symptoms. During this time John has continued to exercise and be active in his social life to feel more fit, and he is continuing to monitor his cholesterol numbers and his heart disease. While John doesn\u2019t want to quit Statins, or lose any weight so he could just skip them altogether like he is about to do, he will do the simplest thing possible to get that healthy living option he wants. So after all the time he has spent with John about the possibility of his getting his CHD back, he will begin a lifestyle management plan (lifestyle risk modification program) with his MD.\nI also want to discuss the idea of helping people take the time to consider the potential benefits and risks of going back to old lifestyles and getting their blood cholesterol numbers into a healthy range (to reduce them to 100 to 120 mEq each). Here are some key points of discussion in answering to that\u2026\n- The risk reduction is great. When someone goes back to a healthy lifestyle, the blood cholesterol level is reduced.\n- This is great when it is a very old person. It may be beneficial for older patients if it works after years of high cholesterol levels.\n- It is a low risk option after a diagnosis of hypertension.", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30.

The exercise was conducted four times a week. The duration of the exercise was 7 days, although the interval was reduced with the exercise that was performed at 10 minutes 25-s intervals.\nWhat was the intervention result?\nOn week 4 of the intervention, on Thursday, the participant completed a 70-minute anaerobic exercise for total heart rate rise of 77 beats/min and total heart rate resistance for the last 4 minutes of the exercise, an interval length of 11 minutes, and a half-hour interval length of 60 minutes. The exercise occurred four times a week over 7 days: (1) 11 consecutive days over a minimum of four 20-minute bouts of activity with the interval length of 11 minutes and half-hour interval length of 60 minutes.

(3) Two weeks of vigorous aerobic conditioning over four 13-minute sessions and training intensity ranged from 18-56% for 15-minute periods and from 21% for 10-minute intervals. (4) Total body strength training, strength building, and resistance training were 5 days for 3 days/week.\nHow did these outcomes compare with other previously published interventions with exercise?\nThe 4 weeks exercise intervention had similar results for total body strength, maximal oxygen uptake, and maximal maximal free oxygen uptake, with an additional positive effect on maximal maximal free oxygen consumption (MFLO) and oxygen desaturation when mixed resistance training was used over 4 weeks.\nHow was this intervention appropriate for this patient population?\nThis exercise was appropriate for this patient population because it aimed to increase maximal heart rate and total body fat percent. The 10-minute intervals resulted in a more intense intensity and higher results for maximal maximal free oxygen uptake and MFLO. The exercise was also performed at higher intensities than other exercise paradigms.\nWhat is a randomized controlled trial?\nStudies have been conducted of an intervention on a very small subset of the population. The randomized controlled trial was conducted over 65 weeks. Because the intervention was implemented by a single physician and in a small group, data could only be collected at one point in time.\nWhat is the overall study approach employed and how is it applicable to the treatment?\nOur study was designed to answer specific questions: Was this intervention comparable to other interventions with exercise", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30.

And which one?\nThe aim of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2016 is for the assessment and evaluation of lifestyle factors. In this context, we aim to determine the prevalence of heart disease among Malaysian adults and to find the association between type of lifestyle factor and the prevalence of heart disease. The prevalence of type of lifestyle factor was 6% for all Malaysians studied. However, the prevalence of heart disease was much higher among high-risk groups. Therefore, in this study, the goal was to identify and evaluate lifestyle factors influencing the prevalence of heart disease.\nAs the most prevalent lifestyle factor in men and women globally, this study evaluated the prevalence of heart disease among men and women aged 15-64 in Malaysia by the World Health Organization and national health surveys on lifestyle factors. The prevalence of heart disease was assessed using the Global Heart Diseases Prevalence and Survival Index (GHP-SIGTIM).\nUsing logistic regression, the prevalence of heart disease among overweight Malaysians aged 20 to 64 years was 10.7% for men and 19.2% for women. There was a significant increase in smoking prevalence in men compared to women. Furthermore, men who smoked more than 60 cigarettes smoked more often than women. Age, higher education, education levels, obesity, physical inactivity and income were independently associated with the prevalence of heart disease. There was also an association between obesity and age, education, and income.\nPeople who have made it to the age of 65 or 75 years should be evaluated for heart disease to prevent a later-stage heart disease diagnosis. In this regard, a national heart rate screening could be performed to be able to diagnose the problem as early as possible. Also, a heart failure screening could be performed to provide a timely diagnosis of cardiac arrest without a risk for cardiovascular mortality.\nHeart disease prevalence in men and women is higher than the general population. Therefore, these findings may be useful in determining the role of lifestyle factors in the development of heart disease.\nThis study is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Licence.\nGraham A (2018) Health and well-being of Malaysians in 2014, Malaysia, 4th ed, World Health Organization. 430 p.\nLee R, Leung S, Tan K, Wong W, Lim S, Vieira A, et al.

These are the first 6 months, a 10-18 year old.\nSo, given the age of the patient, the 60 to 64 year old class of NICE recommends a 10-20% reduction of risk, according to National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). This would in theory include, however, having high-risk people in their care. What can be done:\n- Have a risk calculator available. As of yet, neither the NICE nor EMRs have developed one yet.\n- Increase lifestyle factors such as regular exercise, diet, quitting smoking, blood pressure control, and cholesterol controls to normal levels. One can have high-risk people for a long time. An example of a high-risk person with risk factors at age 70 is a 36-year-old with a BMI of 32. This person's risk could range from 42% to 86%.\n- Reduce their risk of developing CHD by 35%. This would be achievable given the patient's health history and by having high levels of social support and by having adequate education.\n- If the patient's age of 70, has a history of heart disease, the risk of heart attacks increases by 25%. The risk of death from heart disease decreases with age. The patient's risk factors could be increased by 20%, and he may still have a low-risk cardiac condition at 70.\nNICE recommends that the following would be the 8-20% reduction needed for a low-risk person as given by the NICE guidelines,\n- 1) Have a high-risk lifestyle factor (no smoking, no high-cholesterol intake)\n- 2) Have a high-risk lifestyle item as such: no or moderate exercise, no less than 30 min/day of exercise\n- 3) Reduce your cholesterol intake, 90mg/100 ml. ie 150g of nuts 3 times a week\n- 4) Eat at least 100 calories a day of fat-reduced foods (20g-30g nuts and seeds).\n- 5) Do not smoke (and cut up the cigarettes altogether)\n- 6) Consume 3-4 portions of dark, dark green/yellow vegetables or half a raw cupful each day\n- 7) Eat whole plant foods, such as whole grains\n- 8) Avoid dairy products\n- 9) Exercise to 5 x/week\n- 10) Avoid processed foods, bakery products\n- 11) Stop smoking\n- 12) Take your heart-to-heart health check if you have a high-risk history of heart disease\n- 13) Have regular appointments with your physician, to monitor heart and pulmonary health\n- 14) Get a lipid panel test\n- 15) Get regular exercise and talk to your primary care physicians\nIf you are a heart patient, the NICE recommends that you start a heart-healthy lifestyle as soon as you can.\nI understand that we're all going to have to adjust our diets/activities throughout the day, as well as at times of illness.

He responded that his height, body weight, and blood pressure are adequate and that his weight is at only average levels; but he is not overweight/obese (BMI= 23). He also responded that his family history of cardiac mortality is consistent with that of Mr. A. His history of smoking began at the age of 16. Because he recently received his heart medications and has been taking them for at least five years, his BMI is 27 kg/m2, and he has no history of diabetes or hypertension or stroke. In addition, the physician has prescribed three medications (ceftizol and lisinopril) that he is currently using to lower his blood pressure. The physician's notes state that Mr. B has been using these medications for four years and has no coexisting diseases that can affect his heart and circulation. The physician is not concerned with the number of prescriptions being made because he is currently taking his usual classes for six months.\nIn this situation, what BMI should be used under the NICE guidelines? How do we weigh the risks of these three medications to the risk of cardiovascular events?\nWhat are the potential risks of the medications? Will Mr. B be an example of someone who could benefit from the following lifestyle changes? We would recommend the following:\n- Quit smoking\n- Quit drinking alcohol\n- Maintain a healthy weight\nHow may Mr. B have other risk factors for atherosclerosis or other CVD that may increase his risk for a subsequent cardiovascular event?\n1. Body heath: Mr. B's body heath is a high sodium diet. This is because he is overweight or obese. Also, Mr. B's BMI is 30 kg/m2.\n2. Health history: Mr. B, like all men with a BMI of 30 and older, has a history of smoking at least once in his life. This makes the risk of heart disease and other CVD possible.\n3. Family history: Mr. B has a family history of cardiovascular disease.\n4. Health condition: Mr. B's health condition is no longer functioning. Smoking cessation will not reduce Mr. B's cardiovascular risk. Therefore, quitting smoking will not reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in Mr. B. But, smoking cessation medications and therapies may be appropriate.\n5. Medications used: Mr. B's medications were not prescribed to a patient under the age of 30. He is not a patient of Medicare. Therefore, it would not be appropriate for Medicare to reimburse Mr. B for medication management. In addition, Mr. B was not taking his usual classes for six months. A patient's age is an important factor in determining a patient's risk for CVD. Patients under 28 are more likely to have a medical condition, and more likely to have cardiovascular disease than patients over the age of 28. Since Medicare is a United States health insurance program, it will be appropriate to calculate potential Medicare costs based on the age group and the individual characteristics of the patient.\n6. Lifestyle: Mr. B is an athlete. He regularly engages in physical activity. He has no health insurance, so it would be appropriate for Medicare and the government to reimburse him by tax-deductable income taxes to cover his health care costs.\n7. Community practice: Mr. B is in a community practice clinic. To participate in community practice, he should have insurance payouts to his primary care physician in addition to his Medicare payment for the services.

For example, it may assist in detecting or preventing some cardiovascular disease or condition for another patient, and would suggest that a specific care pathway already exists for a relevant condition that is being recognised as a risk factor.\nIn the case of a 70-year-old male, BMI = 30, blood pressure = 114/61 mmHg, Total Cholesterol = 6.7 mmol/L; cholesterol = 1.0 mmol/L; systolic = 114; diastolic = 61; blood pressure = 110 mB/L; total cholesterol = 6.7 mB/L; Total Lipid = 750 mg/dl; HDL = 1.0; HbA1c = 8.7 %.\nAs a medical student, the NHS has been criticised for recommending non-medical treatment for many patients with cardiovascular risk factors (such as high cholesterol). However, a research team led by Dr Ian Hilton at the University of Edinburgh reviewed and collated data showing that an average of some 9.6% of patients were taking anti-hypertensive drugs for a variety of cardiovascular risk factors. The team used data from the 51 Million UK Cohort, which is the largest historical cohort collected by NICE, including 24,463 patients who were taking medical or non-medical treatments to manage their symptoms.\nBased on the NICE recommendations, the researchers advise that a referral from the NHS if the patient is concerned about developing a cardiovascular condition is not recommended and should give a referral to the NCCF cardiovascular care network. However, if the patient shows concern about their condition and wishes to have a specialist referral, then he should consult a specialist cardiology centre in our area.\nDr Hilton says that if the patient is aware of the importance of good nutrition and exercising, he should consider the referral to the NHS.\nHe adds that if the patient has diabetes, he should consult a specialist at his institution, and if both of them are aware of the risks associated with hypertension, they should talk to their doctor.\nThere are currently six cardiac hospitals in the west of the country including Lansdowne Hospital, the hospital of the Diocese of London, the Lansdowne Teaching Hospital, Lansdowne Hospital, Lansdowne Hospital and Lansdowne Hospital, The St Margaret\u2019s Hospital and South Lansdowne Women\u2019s Charity and Lansdowne Hospital (which is now merged into London Hospitals). There are currently two specialist cardiac hospitals in the region: The Newmarket Heart Hospital and West Linton General Hospital.\nA person with a family history of CVD is at increased risk of developing it. There is evidence to suggest that a genetic mutation of lipoprotein metabolism or other metabolic pathways may be the underlying cause of susceptibility to CVD.\n- There is some evidence to suggest that smoking may increase prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, both chronic and acute.\n- Other risk factors may include being overweight and having high blood pressure.\n- Lifestyle changes are also known to lower the risk of developing CVD; for example, eating a healthy, balanced diet with regular exercise.\nA person with a genetic mutation of lipoprotein metabolism or other metabolic pathways may be at increased risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Genetic risk factors are thought to be responsible for 70% of cases. The other 30% are", "Considering John's demographics and health status - a 70-year-old Chinese male, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, free of diabetes, with a family history of CVD - what would be the NICE CVD guidelines applicable to him?", "Considering John's demographics and health status - a 70-year-old Chinese male, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, free of diabetes, with a family history of CVD - what would be the NICE CVD guidelines applicable to him?\nAnswers, questions and discussion for this module can all be found under the 'Themed modules' section:\nIn terms of blood pressure, it appears that patients whose BMI is over 35 are at greater risk of stroke. Also, in terms of total cholesterol this is an underestimate because the figures are based on only a small proportion of the population of a given age and the majority of patients in the clinic have had at least one cardiovascular event of any dimension. On the other hand, if the patient's blood pressure is at a more or less normal reading, and his cholesterol does not exceed 6 mmol/L, that is a clear indication that the patient can continue to be a healthy adult.\nThe most common condition that could be associated with a fall in blood pressure is heart attack, and this will often present as a 'bradycardia' (slow heart rate) or even as an unstable angina. This is largely related to the fact that the patient's body has already been affected in some way by such lifestyle factors as smoking/alcohol consumption, excessive consumption of fat/sugar, or a sedentary/sedentary lifestyle.\nThere is also an increase in the number of heart attack cases associated with obesity, but only a small percentage of it represents a reduction in the risk of heart attack. The increase in the number of heart attacks related to smoking is more pronounced than that from a sedentary lifestyle or increased weight!\nWhen considering smoking, we must also bear in mind that in many nations a smoker is at a higher risk in terms of developing a heart attack, even when they have a healthy lifestyle!\nOn the other hand, diabetes is significantly associated with a higher number of death from coronary heart disease. A lower percentage, a smaller number and more severe the disease can all be associated with a fall in blood pressure. A small increase in blood pressure in the general population in terms of death from coronary heart disease should be at least considered by medical practitioners and should be evaluated in terms of patients aged 40 and over.\nFor every 500 g of sugar or carbohydrates that is consumed a diabetic person is at more than a 40 percent risk of developing diabetes. It is important, however, to keep this number in mind as part of the general recommendation of a healthy lifestyle.\nThere are, however, two important, but quite often neglected lifestyle factors that may be strongly connected to the risk of heart attack and stroke, a sedentary and a sedentary lifestyle. In a majority of cases the only thing that has to worry you about is your waistline, but if you still feel like trying to beat a fat or obese body, you are not doing your heart health any good - you would be better off trying something different.\nA sedentary lifestyle is a simple way of achieving the same objectives as a low fat diet. In addition to the increase in weight that accompanies this lifestyle, there is a decrease in physical activity, exercise and activity that is more frequent in the general population. As of 2013, we do not understand the specific causes of a sedentary or sedentary lifestyle, but it is known that many people are highly active people who often do their shopping at busy shopping centres that are not well situated during the peak hours of the day.\nMost of us do not do a good enough job with our exercise equipment, and therefore we lose valuable resources by this. This is a good reason why we should all try to increase our cardiovascular fitness and improve our general activity levels as much as possible, starting at all stages that we have in progress.\nThere is a simple method that can be used to identify whether your eating habits are actually conducive to your heart health. Ask yourself the following questions:\nAs is often the case in the medical profession, a healthy lifestyle is often one that takes your individual circumstances into consideration. However, a simple method of determining your heart health is to simply ask yourself these two questions again.\n1. Is a person's weight and body composition in proportion healthy?\n2. Does the person's activity level seem reasonable and to be an excellent example of how they are to be moving around and the way they use their body parts?\nWe would therefore recommend that you discuss these two questions with your doctor or physician in order to have a good idea about your health.", "Considering John's demographics and health status - a 70-year-old Chinese male, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, free of diabetes, with a family history of CVD - what would be the NICE CVD guidelines applicable to him?

However, in the next few years it will be necessary for the NHS to deploy a number of different age stratified surveillance programs to provide an early health surveillance programme. In order to achieve this, it is therefore recommended that national, county and city government departments have their own clinical surveillance programmes.\nData needs in this project\n- An evaluation of the effectiveness of a national programme for monitoring the health and fitness of older adults.\n- An observational evaluation of 7 groups of individuals, aged between 65 and 80 who were followed-up to assess their exercise capacity and their exercise-related symptoms.\n- An in-depth evaluation of 11 groups of older adults at risk of CVD (590 patients) using a continuous exercise monitoring protocol.\n- A follow-up of 17,260 people aged 50 - 70 who participated in a nationwide long-term epidemiological study.\n- An analysis of 21,000 samples of blood drawn from 40,000 subjects aged 50 and over.\n- An analysis of health data collected from 91,371 subjects aged 65 to 89 years living in East Lothian.\n- A study of the relationship between physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, weight and smoking.\n- An analysis of data from 5,000 participants in the European Heart Lung Study to evaluate the effectiveness of a UK exercise programme.\nBackground of the project\nThere is no population-based CVD surveillance system in the UK. The most effective model for the surveillance of new cases of heart attack in the UK and the United States is the Coronary Heart Disease Surveillance System (CHDS) based on national data of heart attack incidence rates.

The NICE guidelines are 10-year guidelines that are appropriate for adults with a history of CVD, defined below. Please note, I am talking about a non-smoking Chinese male that is having secondary CVD on his chest (angina) but has no history of CVD on his chest (hypertension). What I am not saying, is that you are free to define the specific CVD risk factors - your personal or family history.

As for my own observations, there is an age-specific guideline (50 years), but that isn't always the case, and I wasn't able to see an age group for my own.

How should the general practitioner (GPs) or the nurse make the appropriate referrals and clinical decision?\n\n-\n\u2022 This is about the UK's NHS guidelines for CVD from the 2005 HMO to the 2020 NHS Act. Some of the definitions can be difficult to interpret: \"Cardiovascular disease\" as above: \"CVD is a constellation of conditions potentially defined as leading to a reduction in cardiac output, including myocardial infarction, stroke or peripheral arterial disease, and cardiac insufficiency, which can lead to death.\" The first 4 definitions are good, but there are still many misconceptions if you're not familiar with the terminology, and in some cases the terminology may be difficult or confusing.\n\u2022 A good way to start though is to learn about the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute guidelines and their equivalents (see: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/cardiovasculardisease/\nThank you!

What will be your best strategy to keep your lifestyle healthy? Does your blood pressure fall within a normal range? Should you be using statins or other anti-inflammatory drugs? If your blood pressure and cholesterol levels remain at healthy levels on first visit, what next?\n|The main goal of a heart clinic exercise programme is to work on muscular fitness in a highly repetitive, progressive manner. Many physical skills can be learnt and extended very quickly at a regular intensity and over a defined period. Therefore, even before patients present with their symptoms, it is advisable to perform a range of exercise to stimulate the heart and improve muscle strength. The training programme should be adapted to the patient by the medical team taking care of their general health as well as their health in general. It is important the cardiovascular system performs a certain activity at a higher intensity or as indicated in this presentation.|\n|When patients present with their symptoms, a complete review of medical history, a general practice work-up and a complete physical examination should be performed (eg. patient presenting with an arrhythmia and a significant family history of heart attacks). It is also advised that a list of drug and dietary supplements should be recorded. This will help to differentiate 'normal' cholesterol levels from significant cardiovascular or metabolic concerns. A complete history and a thorough physical examination should be performed to identify any possible underlying medical problems and evaluate further if appropriate. If there are no other cardiac or metabolic problems, the medical team should continue with a complete rest programme beginning with low intensity activities for the expected period, gradually progressing to higher intensity intensity levels thereafter.|\n|When we talk about the 'first-line' interventions, the first one we are going to consider is the reduction of smoking. In practice, smoking cessation is one of the main interventions which can reduce the risk of stroke and have significant potential benefits in terms of cardiovascular and other disease risks. The risk of stroke is the direct consequence of smoking, but it also has a direct and indirect risk of heart attack through other factors like increased risk of thrombosis and increased risk of myocardial infarction. It will never be enough to simply quit smoking, but a cessation must be done to achieve the best results in terms of heart disease and stroke risk reduction. The primary objective of any intervention is to reduce the total burden of tobacco-related risk in a healthy population. We therefore need to provide patients with both cessation programmes and support to help them reach the best possible outcome.|\n|The main objective of the treatment/supplemental programs/rehabilitation programmes is to provide them with additional help, whether in terms of lifestyle guidance, educational resources, and access to medical care for other diseases which may arise from previous smoking. Therefore, a patient's lifestyle needs are considered as well as the health needs. As a follow-up, the patient will need more support to be able to achieve their recommended lifestyle and avoid future medical problems.|\nAs a general rule, in an emergency, one must call an ambulance. If in doubt, call 999 immediately. If there is no emergency, one should inform the team and the appropriate hospital and you can also book on our website, http://www.healthcareplanner.co.uk/, to have a chat. If you do not yet have access to this service or can not afford to book a chat, call 999 immediately, and you will receive an ambulance. The ambulance will not stop by itself, it will be transporting you to the local emergency department for more urgent treatment. In all emergency rooms, the ambulance will often be available to the front-line medical personnel as well.\n|The most important things people with CVD should know. It is important to understand that CVD is a progressive disease and symptoms tend to worsen over time and may even progress to a state called'reiterating disease' (where the symptom develops into angina or myocardial infarction). However, a gradual reduction in symptoms over a period of months to years can really significantly reduce the mortality rate. The good news, however, is that most people can achieve significant and, importantly, long-lasting (and often longer) reductions in their risk of CVD. On a simple scale, one can measure and compare a patient's level of CVD control (for example, the percentage range from very high to very low). It should be noted that a patient who controls their CVD well over time and not significantly increases their risk of CVD has a positive effect. People with CVD have a very low probability of having significantly reduced or without reduction in risk of any other CVD, but their risk of CVD is usually substantial.|\n|If the patient has been diagnosed with a heart", "Considering John's demographics and health status - a 70-year-old Chinese male, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, free of diabetes, with a family history of CVD - what would be the NICE CVD guidelines applicable to him?\nCardiovascular risk will differ in an individual with age and health status. This could lead to different recommendations for the population; but also it could cause differences in the assessment of risk factors in individuals with more severe CVD risk. In the present case study it is suggested that the age of individuals diagnosed with ASCVD but not in the population at large is 60. The following considerations highlight the appropriateness of age-derived CVD guidelines for the specific population involved:\n1) When assessing risk, a patient's baseline age, sex, and health status are not necessarily the same as the community average. Age is a key determinant of risk for these patients - as young adults have a higher chance of developing severe disease but are less likely to develop cardiovascular disease.\n2) While age is the most important determinant of risk and will therefore be used most often, it is also important to remember that age can also influence health status, health behaviours, and health outcomes. A patient with advanced (advanced) cardiovascular disease will have different circumstances than a patient with a non-vivo disorder.\nSome of the recommendations in the present case study for the guideline use should be based on age-specific recommendations, as this is a very individualised and complex issue. Age-derived risk and guidelines should be adapted to local circumstances but as a general guideline an age-derived and age-specific CVD risk calculator would be of considerable utility. This tool would then be readily accessible from the public health services.\nThe importance of age-derived risk is evident in this case study: it will give a better picture of the individual\u2019s baseline risk of dying, disease stage, and progression to mortality. It will improve the risk-benefit analysis in risk stratification and planning, and therefore aid in the treatment and prevention of CVD. Older people may also benefit in certain areas of life such as health behaviour change and prevention efforts - for example, smoking cessation.\nIn summary, age-derived CVD risk calculators can be of considerable benefit for individualising care and decision making for individuals who are young and in better physical shapes. However this needs to be done in collaboration, with the community, with the medical staff, and with the patient and the consumer to ensure the risk-benefit and cost-benefit are optimised.\nMolloy, N., et al., \u201cDragoon\u2019s A-to-Z Guide to Cardiovascular Diseases.\u201d In: Merchandising & Health Care in Development, 2014. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4371969/\n\u201cCardiovascular Disease in the Western World.\u201d Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia. 9 Oct. 2012. 28 Mar. 2013. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease>.\nLauw, K., \u201cHeart Disease Rates, Incidence and Deaths Reported in the United States, by Race/Ethnicity, 2011.\u201d The Hospital for Sick Children, 2013. http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/2013/05/heart-disease-rates-incidence-and-deaths-reported-in-the-united-states-2011.php\n\u201cPrevention and Control of Diabetes.\u201d NLM.\n\u201cNHS Cardiovascular Services England (2008).

Why?\n- What is risk factors associated with CVD in terms of the NICE guidelines for older people?\nWhy is the NHS's CVD guidelines recommended for the older population?\nBy the middle of the 20th Century, most of us understood a more complex model of health behaviour and health risk. These models of behaviour were in fact built on empirical evidence from the preceding decades of science - a system that is generally defined by the number of data points. The NHS and the general population have done this over many decades and in this time period, the more complex data about health behaviour has increasingly been analysed to provide a more accurate view of health that can be applied to different age groups.\nFrom 2006, the NHS began to look at the data not just in terms of general trends, but at specific specific behaviours, like heart disease, using models of ageing. As the ages of people increased, the degree to which behaviours associated with these changes had already evolved and therefore the effect of changes that were later identified had to be considered. The NHS undertook a systematic review of evidence into cardiovascular risk factors in detail, examining the data to determine which interventions would be appropriate for younger people. The report summarises:\n- The risk of disease and disability associated with heart attack.\n- The effect of lifestyle factors on heart disease in old age.\n- What evidence was available and how best to apply it.\nAnd as the age range of the oldest patients with CVD increased, the evidence from this stage revealed that the best interventions for preventing heart attacks (or the best interventions for preventing other cardiovascular disease) tended to follow some sort of hierarchy. These interventions appeared to be particularly beneficial in older patients (and in the case of heart attack the only relevant time point was the year following the original presentation and for heart attack that was 6 years after, regardless of any symptoms.\n- What would you recommend in the case of young young people on these interventions compared to those on other interventions that may be more relevant?\nThe NHS guidelines can be used as a resource to examine the individual risk profiles. We found that 87% of 60- to 75-year-olds from the NHS cohort who presented with a coronary event could be classified as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in a particular age group (see chart above). This is a far cry from the model of risk that has been used in scientific literature for many years, which is based on a single data point and a relatively simple model of risk. This model had limitations in developing recommendations, however, and the evidence was not that clear-cut.\n- How did the NHS guidelines address this issue? Which interventions are recommended? Which interventions alone are the most appropriate?\nThese guidelines, rather than providing an ideal model for different age groups, highlighted the need to consider each individual and the unique factors associated with this person. The NHS included certain questions in the guidelines to assess whether a specific intervention was likely to be appropriate for a given patient.\n- If your NHS would have done this, would it have acted in a similar way?\nFor the NHS guidelines, the answer to this is that they have not been designed to work on a one-size-fits-all basis; rather they are based on a set of assumptions about where a given cohort will fall on the spectrum of cardiovascular risk.\n- Can you speculate what the evidence is for different risk profiles in different areas using different models (e.g. cardiovascular risk in particular areas)? Would it be relevant to what age range of patients would benefit from this?\nThe NHS has a fairly recent set of statistical methods and models that are useful for understanding different risk profiles in individual patients and populations. They were used for the 2006 cohort study to address the effect of age on cardiovascular risk, and for the 2008 study it was included in the guideline to address the effect of gender on cardiovascular risk.\nMore recent work has been undertaken in the field of metabolic risk factors, which is an important area of research. For example, the work that has been done in the domain of cardiometabolic risk factors, but without a particular focus on cardiovascular risk, is important when assessing whether any recommendations have merit.\nIn the following question, you will be asked about the application of the model of risk to a clinical cohort.\nWhat advice might you give to an older person from a health professional with a patient group study in regard to a clinical approach to identifying those at risk of CVD in an elderly cohort?\n- What might you advise older persons from a health professional in your area"], "2": ["Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?

Strategies such as quitting smoking, quitting smoking, managing blood pressure and cholesterol levels, controlling stress, maintaining a healthy weight, and reducing salt intake are all useful in preventing stroke.\nQ: What are some strategies for people who do not smoke?\n-", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him? What is the likelihood his death will occur from a CVD event?\nA heart rate of 70 beats per minute or higher indicates an arrhythmia. Therefore, any condition which elevates resting heart rate would be classified as an arrhythmia. Also, if heart rate does not rise above 100 bpm, the patient might be an atrial fibrillation person with an inoperability of atrial cells which would cause a stroke. These conditions do not cause a CVD event.\nThe heart rate to blood pressure ratio, which indicates how the left ventricle is squeezing blood into the heart, should not decrease below 0.9. Furthermore, the left ventricular filling pressure and output should not increase below 10 cm Hg. Furthermore, if any organ has an above normal heart rate, such as a diseased or hypertensive heart, the person should undergo lifestyle changes. These lifestyle changes are also considered to be key in preventing heart attacks and blood vessel diseases, which are the most important factors in CVD development. Lifestyle changes include eating healthily, exercising regularly, quitting smoking (all of which can also prevent stroke), and maintaining a healthy weight.\n- A person has 1.20 times the chance of becoming a victim of heart attack to the person who has never died from a heart attack?\nA person with a 1.20 increased death risk is less at risk. In other words, the death risk decreases over time when the patient has a 1.20 increased mortality. However, the decreased risk of fatality for increased mortality was not present for people with no CVD risk factor.\nIn the US and the UK, heart attacks (CHs) account for over 100,000 deaths each year. A high risk for people may be anyone of any age, whether they have diabetes or hypertension, or are smokers. There should be no reason for a person to be diagnosed with an MI, and they can make a lifestyle change if they are diagnosed.\nExercise, as well as a healthy diet, are extremely important in this event. There is no significant evidence that exercise prevents CVD from developing, as most of the evidence is from people who are already established at risk, or from people who are at high risk because of cardiovascular disease.\n- The patient has 1.32 times the chance of the patient with normal blood pressure having a stroke or a heart attack?\nA normal blood pressure should not lower below 100/60 millimeters of mercury. Additionally, a normal blood pressure should not decrease below 100/60 millimeters of mercury, because any alteration in this value will cause an arrhythmia. Because of this, a healthy lifestyle should not cause the patient to develop one of these pathologies. To prevent a coronary event, a person with normal blood pressure should take at least three sessions of medication per year, and not be more than a couple sessions per year.\nA healthy lifestyle, as well as a healthy diet, provide the foundation for preventing and controlling heart disease which is the main cause of death. The average American does not have many years for cardiac health improvement. Furthermore, patients with a cardiac death risk will still have family members who have died with the same disease, such as someone\u2019s grandfather or grandmother. Therefore, it is recommended to follow a healthy lifestyle to prevent heart disease or its related death.\nThe person has a heart attack (HAD) to the person with normal blood pressure causing a stroke or a heart attack?\nA sudden change in heart rate will cause the patient to be hypoxic, and a patient is no longer stable or is in cardiogenic shock. In such states, the patient should be evaluated for an arrhythmia. Furthermore, a patient is also at a higher risk of cardiovascular death due to a high risk of mortality, because a person with a CVA (a heart attack) is at a very high risk of death. Conversely, if a patient has an arrhythmia, the risk associated with the arrhythmia is still higher. Therefore, when a patient has a sudden change in heart rate, the patient should take at least a few minutes to assess the heart rate using methods which are different from those used for a normal heart rate. When the heart rate is less than 60 bpm, and the patient goes above or below 100 bpm, the patient should be evaluated for an arrhythmia.\nAn arrhythmia can cause sudden cardiac arrest which can be life threatening. Furthermore, the risk of a cardiac death (Cardiac Death) will not increase as much as if a person has had an arrhythmia", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\n- What are the NICE guidelines for cardiovascular prevention for this man?

NICE has defined Heart Disease as \u201ccardiovascular disease with a duration or morbidity of more than 30 years, leading to a significant decrease in wellbeing of the person (including death) or disability, which does not fall under the usual medical management framework in the community.\u201d In a person with a high prevalence of CVD, you could use the term lifestyle-related CVD. For example, obesity, hypertension, smoking, etc., all can be included under lifestyle-related CVD and have an increased risk of CVD if not addressed. If you use lifestyle-related CVD, we recommend you to speak with a cardiologist to discuss the risks and identify other, complementary, and non-invasive factors contributing to your risk for CVD.\nIt takes about two-thirds of these factors to develop cardiovascular disease. The rest remain unlisted but could be addressed and perhaps reduced. First, smoking cessation may prevent some people from developing CVD later on, though this is not a guarantee. Although not always, smoking may also damage your blood vessels, which can also contribute to CVD. Second, you should have a comprehensive risk assessment, which may include a heart rate monitor, to know your baseline baseline, including when is it normal, and whether you smoke. Your risk for atherosclerosis would improve if the person had a history of a heart attack or stroke. You may also need screening for diabetes and risk factors.\nThird, you may need to be aware of your weight, as this has a direct impact on your risk for having CVD. Having a healthy BMI can slow the progression of heart disease. BMI also increases your risk for some diseases that also lead to CVD. For example, obesity also increases your risk for diabetes, which increases the probability of developing CVD later.\nYour healthcare provider should refer you to a cardiologist, who may prescribe other therapies as well. They can also refer you to a specialist or an endocrinologist, if your condition is related to infertility.\nHere are some information sources for this topic\nAmerican Heart Association, 2018. \u201cOverview of Coronary Artery Disease.\u201d https://www.american.health.gov/condition/coronary-artery-disease#overview-of-coronary-artery-disease.\nAmerican Heart Association, 2018. \u201cCardiovascular Disease. Prevalence of risk factors for cardiovascular disease: prevalence and risk factors\u201d. https://www.american.health.gov/condition/cardiovascular-disease#prevalence-risk-factors.", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\nWhen looking at NICE recommendations for CVD prevention in individuals at high risk of CVD, blood pressure \u2265140/90 mmHg and cholesterol \u226570 mg/dL, it is important to distinguish between factors associated with high blood pressure and those associated with high cholesterol, which is the problem here in this case.\nThis is not a common problem and can be difficult to discern clinically. So, our next step is to look at the risk of CVD in individuals with this blood pressure range. Here we look at the results by whether it is high or moderate and also for those who score >80% for their risk of CVD.\nIn other words, those with a blood pressure above about 140/90 mmHg are very likely to have a much higher risk of developing CVD. We know that blood pressure is the most important biomarker but, given the prevalence of both conditions, blood pressure is one of the most important risk markers. If we are looking at a very large population, we look for a high percentage of those with >140/90 and moderate or low percentage of those \u226580%. We don\u2019t look for high percentages but rather look at the proportion of each. The most common risk groups, among those who had CVD or who are at high risk of CVD are men, the most common risk group, and the most common cause is smoking. There is a high risk of dying from CVD if it\u2019s higher. So, in order to have this high risk, it means that there is a greater risk than would otherwise be because many people will die from CVD. The same can also hold true for heart disease. With age, the heart disease risk is increased by 10 years for every 10 years of age gain, so that\u2019s 10 years of age gain. That increased risk is compounded by the fact that the people are already at high risk because they smoke or have a family history of CVD. If someone is not overweight, if they don\u2019t have diabetes, and if they don\u2019t have high blood pressure, having a low risk of atherosclerosis makes the risk of dying from CVD decrease. We need that same number of those who have risk factors, who have a family history of CVD, but we also need to look at smoking, which again, is one of the biggest factors. So, smoking is going to make it more likely that you might have developed coronary artery disease.\nWhat is the most important piece of information that we can give you about CVD prevention?\nWe also need to talk about what we need to focus on in the near term and long term. We need to look at the number of years you should be able to expect from your first event. And this is where you have a very bad chance of preventing the onset of CVD or reducing its intensity or duration.\nIf we stop smoking and don\u2019t smoke, our risk will become 50% less. That won\u2019t take longer to happen. If we quit because we\u2019re at 45%, our risk will reduce by 50% in this case. In terms of that, the heart is probably not going to change, probably not going to stop. In terms of the individual, some may say \u201cI\u2019ve never smoked, so I just have to quit, and I\u2019m going to get it out of my way. Well, we need to give it a try, because it\u2019s going to work.\nHow do you feel about the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention, and what do you think should be changed?\nNICE recommendations are in the public domain, so we expect them to be around the country or around the world. But, given the large size of this population and the challenges that they have, what changes do you think to these guidelines, and how much of those changes is likely to help reduce the risks seen in the community?\nWhat happens if we want to start a new programme? Do we really need to start a new programme immediately?\nIt\u2019s not likely to be a new programme overnight, but we should try to start by reducing the risk of CVD as much as possible by looking at the underlying causes as a whole. For instance, if you think about how much of your own risk comes from the lifestyle choices that you make. And that also means eating more fresh fruit and vegetables, limiting your consumption of sugary drinks, or physical activity, and so on. Then we should look at the overall levels that risk is going to be, to start where it is, and hopefully then", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\nWhat is the main message of the NICE guideline?\nThe NICE guideline is intended to educate patients on the importance of lifestyle changes. Patients are advised not to improve their lifestyle, their lifestyle control and lifestyle management should include physical exercise at regular intervals. It is important to reduce the intake of sugar or refined sugar, eat mostly low fat foods, eat a diet of fruits and vegetables along with dairy foods and to avoid saturated fats, reduce alcohol intake and limit saturated fats, including red meat and red meat products.\nWhat are the other recommendations from the NICE guideline?\nThe NICE guideline also recommends that patients have regular cholesterol tests. The NICE guideline also recommends treatment with statins should be started at any age, and can be tailored to a patient\u2019s risk of CVD, taking this into account. Patients should also be counsel about how to prevent and manage hypercholesterolemia, such as by eating a healthy diet and reducing the intake of refined sugar.\nConclusion: Which is the NICE guideline for CVD prevention in Japanese patients?\nThe NICE guidelines recommend that patients have regular cholesterol tests and should take medications to help control high cholesterol and prevent heart disease.

(Use the NICE guidelines in Excel from below.) Your response is as follows:\nYou will not receive detailed recommendations for a risk factor for CVD from NICE, but your answer is in line with the guidelines.\nThe NICE guidelines suggest that regular exercise (aerobic activity, strength training) can help lower blood pressure by 5.0 mmHg/day.\n(You should discuss with a doctor if your physician prescribes a medication for your condition, as it is important to follow the dose based on a patient's health.)\nYour doctor asked this if you smoke, for example.\nYou can only get a full explanation for this NICE guideline if you have read this very short guide for a person with ASCVD. If you cannot answer this question in your own words this is the kind of information you need.\nThe NICE guidelines recommend that regular exercise (aerobic activity, strength training) can help lower blood pressure by 5.0 mmHg/day.\nFor a sedentary person who needs regular cardiovascular exercise, the recommended amount of weight-bearing exercise would be 150-200 minutes a week.\nThe recommended amounts for healthy sedentary people is 30 minutes of walking most days of the week.\nAccording to a review of the evidence and expert opinion:\nThe evidence from studies conducted in the last 1-2 decades shows that daily weight-bearing exercise can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.\nSo, daily weight-bearing exercise could be an effective way of preventing cardiovascular diseases.(1)\nSo, daily weight-bearing exercise could be considered an effective way of preventing cardiovascular diseases if you are diagnosed with ASCVD.\nExercise is a common recommendation for preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes.\nExercising at least 150 minutes a week could be considered a preventive measure.\nIf you are not considered very active, or have moderate levels of cardiovascular disease, do not exercise.\nIf you are at risk for cardiovascular disease, reduce the number and duration of daily exercise and/or get up and walk more frequently.\nGet up and walk more often.\nGet up and walk more often.\nIf you are not considered very active, and have cardiovascular disease, but do not have risk factors for cardiovascular disease, talk to your doctor or healthcare professional to know whether you could benefit from extra aerobic exercise for your level of cardiovascular disease.\nIf you have cardiovascular risk factors, you probably should exercise at least ten minutes each day in terms of aerobic exercise or weight-bearing exercises.\nIf you do not have cardiovascular risk factors, you probably should not exercise at least 150 minutes a week in terms of aerobic exercise or weight-bearing exercises.\nIf you are diagnosed with cardiovascular disease and have not been classified as at high-risk, you may have high-risk exercise level, moderate-risk exercise level, or low-risk exercise level based on your fitness level and other risk factors.\nExercise is considered a preventive measure if you have cardiovascular disease.\nThe recommended level of exercise a person should do is five or 10 minutes.\nFor healthy people not suffering from cardiovascular disease and not at risk for cardiovascular disease, doing aerobic exercise can be considered to have protection\nIf you are diagnosed with cardiovascular disease and have at moderate to high risk of a heart attack, you should do 10-12 minutes of aerobic cardiovascular exercise (the number will depend on your age and fitness level).\nIf you have heart attack, you should moderate the amount of aerobic exercise you do for five minutes or greater every day.\nTalk to your doctor about your exercise type and level of risk before doing more aerobic exercise than five minutes.\nSome experts believe it is important to increase the recommended amount of aerobic exercise gradually over time and keep it as low a level as possible.\nIf you are not overweight, exercise with weights and do exercise slowly over and over again instead of hard up and on as it could be a resistance exercise.\nThis type of exercise can be very effective to reduce the risk of heart.\nThere are several exercises that can help people with the risk factor of ASCVD such as swimming, tennis, golf, running, cycling, walking uphill, yoga, Pilates and many others.\nWhen it comes to heart rate, you should begin exercising with medium intensity level.\nAfter that, the intensity is increased to about 70-85% of your heart rate maximum during any one or a few workout at the highest level and at a moderate level.\nIf you are still", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\nAt age 45, a person will have a reduced risk of cardiovascular events compared to age 45 for any cause. Your risk of CVD is therefore reduced. You can be as much as 20 years younger but still have a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke; therefore it is not possible for an older person to have just lowered risk without increasing risk of developing disease. This risk can also be reduced if the person also has a reduced risk of certain malignancies. See table 1.", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\nCVD risk factors for obesity (over 50 kcal/d for men and 34 kcal/d for women)\nExcessive body fat, defined by body mass index (BMI) >25 is associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes.\nExcessive body fat is strongly associated with non-insulin intensive chronic disease risk factors.\nWhat are the NICE guidelines for blood pressure control?\nAt doses of 75-105 millidecagrams (Md) of sodium per day, the risk of a hypoglycemic stroke is 0.5%; however at doses of 90-125 mEq/kg of sodium per day, death is possible with a risk of 8%.\nWhy is risk of type 2 diabetes assessed by HbA1C (the result of a continuous glucose monitoring program) rather than using the HbA1c (results from a blood test)?\n- HbA1c is an indirect measure of average blood sugar concentration of the past 180 days. Therefore compared with blood sugar levels, HbA1C reflects blood glucose levels.\n- Monitoring HbA1c in the context of a diabetes management plan is very important, because the HbA1c level is directly correlated with the probability of diabetes.\nHow would one calculate a 5% risk of developing type 2 diabetes after using the HbA1c measurement in conjunction with a physician?\n- A 5% risk is calculated as 5 mmol/L (millid\n- mL/lit) over 75-105 mmol/kg daily (see NICE guidance 2). Note that a 3 mmol/L increase to the HbA1c level is a 3 mmol/L increase in a high glucose hyperglycemic (hypotensive) state (as calculated by a blood glucose level of 400 mg/dl for adults with normal blood pressure values and normal HbA1c levels).\n- This means that if you have a 47 mmol/L HbA1c level, you are 5% at risk for developing type 2 diabetes.\nDiabetes prevention requires lifestyle modifications, including diet and exercise. What other lifestyle modifications do you suggest to those with a BMI of over 30 for over 1 year (including BMI > 35 for individuals with a BMI >40)?\n- Exercise (30\u201350 minutes of exercise at least 5 times a week)\n- Eat a well-balanced diet (exclusively if carbohydrate or fat will lower the need for insulin)\n- Choose between low-fat dairy products, fat-free, or low-fat milk, yoghurt, or calcium reduced, soy milk\n- Limit added sugars, such as refined cane or fruit sugars in foods and drinks, sugar-sweetened beverages, sweetened fruit juices, confectionary, sweeteners, and low-fat or reduced-fat milk and yoghurt\n- Choose whole fruit rather than juice\n- Eat more vegetables, and eat vegetables with more fat or less fat\nWho might benefit from a 5% diabetes risk assessment and who would benefit from a 5% lifestyle modification programme?\n- Children living in homes with at least one adult suffering from a 5% diabetes who have one adult suffering from diabetes and is not otherwise receiving care that will result in improvement of the individual.\n- Households with two or three adults either suffering or having a 5% diabetes. A 5% diabetes risk assessment could help to identify individuals who might benefit from such support.

The most pressing topic that will require the most intense exercise is a person with a BMI of 30 or higher and a 5-year history of smoking. Although you may feel overwhelmed by the amount of information available, a person with 70 years of age is still young, which can result in a person with 30 or higher being older and have a greater tendency to develop CVD. In addition, if your BMI is 30 or higher, your cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar, and other risk factor are elevated, you have a better chance of developing CVD. Having a high BMI can have a greater impact on your body and what your body can do if you are not actively exercising. The American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association recommend that adults with an BMI of 30 or higher engage in 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise, three days a week or about five days a week. The average American individual walks at approximately 3 mph during the day or about 3 miles in an hour; it is not a marathon. People should consult a physician for specific advice.\nFor people who are overweight or obese for any reason, it is important to lose some weight. The most common method of weight loss is by using restrictive dieting, such as calorie restriction. Many people with obesity begin dieting as soon as they walk and see that their BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, and heart rate go down. However, this method of weight management is not for everyone, and you can lose more weight by using more physical activity. I will discuss how, and the number of people I have discussed to do this in a subsequent post.\nFinally, I have not yet covered any advice that could improve someone\u2019s chances of experiencing any form of CVD. I have read that eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly can prevent a stroke and heart attack. I am confident that the person I have talked to about my diagnosis will be able to determine if these things are worth looking into, given the fact that this can have a significant impact on the future of their cardiovascular health.\nThe author of this article is Maude Williams-Baker, MPH, RN, FAAN, CDE, of The Center for Evidence-Based Nursing and Dietetics of the National Cooperative Endowment for Health Education and Nursing.", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\n- How would you define the 'typical' cardiovascular risk factors?\nIt is generally agreed that cardiovascular risk factors are the cause of most cases of high-risk CVDs in normal weight people, and can be prevented by altering these lifestyle factors. These six risk factors are:\n- body fat - high adiposity is associated with high body fat of the brain, large blood vessels and blood pressure\n- smoking - tobacco causes increased risk for many other lifestyle-related risk factors\n- blood pressure - especially in women, hypertension is a major risk factor for CVDs\n- smoking, weight and waist circumference - although in overweight people, the association of BMI to risk of CVDs is unclear\n- eating, lack of, high fibre foods, sedentary lifestyle, reduced physical activity, sedentary life style and alcohol intake\n- total cholesterol/HDL/LDL, BMI/BMI >40, high triglycerides, high cholesterol and high blood pressure all of which are considered risk factors\nWhen people are at high risk of CVD, the recommended lifestyle modifications include:\n- avoiding cigarette smoking\n- losing weight (particularly if overweight)\n- doing aerobic exercise for at least 20'minutes' per day\n- eating 50 to 60 per cent of calories from carbohydrate\n- losing a pound of body weight a week\n- maintaining a healthy weight\nIt should be emphasised that although these recommendations appear simple, there is no simple answer to the complex issue of what to do, and the answers vary according to body fat and weight. Therefore it is highly advisable to discuss your own situation with your GP, so that you and your decision-makers have a realistic opportunity to make a personal decision.\nI was diagnosed in late 2007 with high cholesterol. My cholesterol levels went up in the early evening, and my overall glucose level did not increase significantly. Is this a problem. My doctor said that was not a problem anymore, and I was told that it was a problem. I tried some cholesterol-lowering medicines, but they were not really helpful, because I was very active and had a lot of work. Could it really happen like this?\nNo, it wouldn't. There are many factors to consider. For some people, particularly older people, cholesterol levels will not go up and may even go down, because of a normal loss of fat during ageing. However, the amount of cholesterol in the blood has actually a lot more to do with the amount of fat in our bodies. Most of the fat in our body is the same as the fat that makes up our joints, which is called free fatty acids. The amount of cholesterol is not the only factor affecting cholesterol levels. The amount of cholesterol which sticks to the walls of the blood vessels is called 'bad cholesterol'. This is a different type of cholesterol to 'good' cholesterol, and it can be difficult to prevent this form of cholesterol getting deposited in the walls of blood vessels.\nPeople with diabetes are more likely to have high cholesterol levels because diabetes causes too much insulin to be used by the body. The pancreas produces too much insulin, which gets into the wall of the blood vessel, where it can stick to the cholesterol from the fat in the arteries. High numbers of cholesterol sticking to the walls of blood vessels also increases the risk of other types of blood vessel clogging - for instance it increases the risk of heart disease. This is why having the right level of cholesterol is such an important prevention for people with diabetes.\nI have recently had my first heart attack. My heart attack caused my blood sugar to be too high. What is the risk of this happening again?\n- A heart attack is a serious medical condition for which the only cure is heart surgery. If the heart has been completely diseased but still needs to be kept alive, this may not be an appropriate treatment. There is some evidence that certain blood-activating drugs can be used effectively to prevent any more life-threatening things happening again in people who have suffered a heart attack, but the data available is quite limited so far and has only been studied in some very small numbers of cases.\nI have had my second heart attack. What were the risks of this heart attack?\nFor most of us, the risk of having any second heart attack is very low, at least in the first few months of your life. As we go on to live longer, it is possible that we may require new medications and treatments to prevent other heart attacks. It is also possible that our lives will be changed. These treatments do not appear to have any harmful effects on our life-long condition", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\nYou can give the individual who has symptoms of CVD, and the NICE guidelines, which is a document, a guideline, a guideline, a strategy, and a technique, and that has a number of clinical and scientific terms, which are very clear. You can read about that, and you have to get into the process. That is very important.\nThen, one of the things that I think that are the most important is if you can give 50% to 70% of it, it\u2019s not that great. So you\u2019re not making any effort to follow it with any medication. It should only be taken up to 1.\n05 mg/day, and that is about 12 mg/day for any drug or 15 mg for the whole 24 hours, and it also is better to take it up to 4 times a day. There is always a slight chance to lose some blood stream if it\u2019s 4 times a day that it can be 3 times a day or 4 times, but that is the number that we can say, 3.\nTaken as one treatment, or 1.05 mg/day is not too good, but take 4 times a day or 15 mg.\nThen, the second thing that I would like to mention in this is that the medications that do exist, that treat CVD, have side effects. So, if I\u2019m on a combination of metformin and aspirin, aspirin will increase my LDL, the bad cholesterol, you can lower LDL, the good cholesterol, and even lower triglycerides. There\u2019s another medication, the drug that\u2019s been used for heart attack, there are some that are more strong and they need to be a doctor\u2019s prescription. I think what\u2019s best, and when we know the science, and this has been done, and you know, when we know the science, we can understand how the drugs work, and can prescribe drugs that could really help.\nAlso, to have better health, and be able to think more about them, you need to have good knowledge. I don\u2019t know what would be better if the drug, because you know, the doctors know that it will be more effective, and if I say 15 mg, that is a less powerful drug, and some doctors I have seen on the internet, some doctors have been on their tablets for about two weeks, have been able to reduce their LDL cholesterol by that amount, and it\u2019s a pretty low number and it\u2019s 3.\n05 mg/day. So I would rather have what I know about blood vessels. They also know a lot about CVD or how the heart works, and they\u2019ve just been developed drugs for it and they can prescribe it. We could even do another study if we know exactly what drugs do that work and if we know the results, when we have blood pressure of more than 160/90, or smoking history, we can prescribe such drugs to a person with CVD.\nDo you think there are any side effects for these drugs?\nTo your point, as I discussed at the beginning, I think all the side effects are extremely rare and not serious, just as many as other medicines. I think that the reason that many people have not been diagnosed with heart attacks or strokes is because they don\u2019t know about the side effects, but they are still having a heart attack in their heart, and they get treatment and the doctor makes them safe and they stop on medications.\nI tell you that those medications, and if they had been known at the time of their conception, who knows what could have happened in between conception and delivery? So, I think it is very important and it is true for all kinds of drugs at the moment. Do you think there are any side effects for that? Yes, I think it\u2019s very uncommon, but some people are having problems with some of them. For example, in the past, some people have been prescribed metformin because they have a risk of a big heart attack as well as high blood pressure, and they did have severe kidney problems.\nI have seen these patients with kidney damage for a long while. Well, one of the reasons is that their kidney function will get bad before the drug is given, it\u2019s not a problem, and that type of thing is never going to happen. With metformin, you know, every day, it can work better, better, better, but", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\n- The NICE guidelines provide recommendations for prevention of cardiovascular disease based on high and moderate levels of physical activity, a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables, limiting the intake of salt, saturated fat, and sugar, and tobacco use.\n- Niche2 is recommended by NICE as an essential service in low- and middle-income countries to help people make informed and evidence-based choices about their cardiovascular risk.", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\nA: If this person is at substantial risk of having CVD, the key is to aim to achieve a healthy weight that is both manageable and in compliance with lifestyle recommendations. This includes improving all other modifiable risk factors, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and cholesterol. The aim is to achieve ideal lipid targets by age 65 (which is normal) or older (and not in sync with your personal medical management). The mainstay is a 40% weight loss and other blood pressure goals for age, a 27% weight goal for blood pressure and a 20% reduction in diabetes risk over 25 years. If this person is over 50, then cholesterol levels should be decreased by all measures.\nThese guidelines are based on a systematic review by the American College of Cardiology (ASH) and have been endorsed by NICE.\nLately, researchers have concluded that the risk of developing stroke and cardiovascular mortality is largely due to high blood pressure in those with the lowest BMI.\nThe goal is for your health care team to develop health-conscious dietary and health-promoting lifestyle plans in partnership with you.\nI am not sure how much information you need to find in this resource, so perhaps you should ask somebody, to ask any health-related questions. Health-related questions may involve your age, weight, gender, height, smoking status, family history of conditions, family history of diabetes or other conditions, the presence or absence of heart attack, or the development of coronary artery disease, coronary heart disease, or stroke.\nAs there is so little consensus and agreement on how to best protect our health \u2013 but there is one common theme I would like to offer you at this point.\nI am a registered nurse and have been on the medical field for over 25 years. I understand the basic concepts and research on risk factors for CVD and I have also tried to come up with tips to help you lose weight, control your blood pressure, maintain a healthy weight, and prevent your risk of diabetes.\nI know that there is a lot we need to know when it comes to nutrition as it may go into many different categories \u2013 and with a wide range of other nutrition topics that are covered by the AHA (pronounced as \u201cH-Oh\u201d \u2013 the \u201cH\u201d stands the for Health), or the CDC (pronounced \u201cC-O-R\u201d \u2013 they tell the CDC about things that may be done, such as medications.\nI like to think of things as the foundation, so for that reason we will learn more about different health topics. We just need each person in your life to figure out what is best for them. The more you eat right the fewer problems you will have. Here are a few of the basic principles I would love to share with you:\n*Eat a nutrient dense diet \u2013 It is not the size of the plate when it comes to your diet or your health. In the long term (a lifetime), you should eat five each day of fruits and vegetables, two a day of whole grains, three or four eggs, one cup chicken breast or lean red meat a day, and one medium sized serving of fish, seafood, or a meatless dish.\n*Limit sugary drinks to 10 percent of your drinking limit or in the evening, to 250 centilitres or less of liquid a day, and it is critical to the development of good cardiovascular health.\n*Avoid sugar-sweetened beverages, and sweet fruits are a rich source of beneficial nutrients, vitamins, or minerals.\n*Keep your overall fat and saturated fatty acid levels to less than 10 percent of intake.\n*Focus on the kinds found naturally in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains that are rich in complex carbohydrates and protein.\nWhen things go wrong or you notice that your risk of disease from eating unhealthy, you may try a food sensitivity test. You can find out if in fact there is a problem by visiting the Mayo Center for Research Resources, they have a couple of free tests you can use to determine if you have a food sensitivity. We could not find someone who really knew this and we didn\u2019t want to pass on your information, so here it is.\nI read that the AHA (pronounced as \u201cHA-oh\u201d \u2013 the \u201cOH\u201d stands the for Health) recommend taking:\n- Whole Grains \u2013 whole grains (the \u201cG\u201d) include:\nOats, Brown Rice, Wheat Germ\n- Fruits and Vegetables \u2013 fruits and vegetables are good sources of many important nutrients, vitamins", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him? Why do I need to be careful to understand the NICE guidelines? I\u2019m very confused. I do not want to spend hours reading and following every guideline, but I will need to know what I can, and I really don\u2019t want to be forced to learn these recommendations for myself, and get myself worried that at best I\u2019ll get a mediocre outcome.

There are many drugs to reduce the bad cholesterol, the bad cholesterol, and the good cholesterol. In addition to this, the treatment of diabetes is also an important factor for the prevention and therapy. Therefore, many studies recommend reducing the intake of saturated fat and cholesterol; the amount of fat in the diet should be reduced; dietary lipid lowering drugs such as statin(Niacin) and the reduction of bad cholesterol, the good cholesterol can reduce the chances of heart diseases can be prevented with the help of diet; also, it is necessary to reduce the amount of cigarette smoking as well as excessive alcohol consumption.\nIn the table below, the NICE recommendations have not been written, but it has been established that to prevent chronic diseases, it is necessary to have a combination of the following:\n(NICE: < 300mg) > 300mg\n(NICE: < 100mg) > 300mg\n(NICE: 0-100mg) > 100mg\n(NICE: 100-125mg) > 125mg\n(NICE: > 135mg)\nIn addition to this, the treatment of diabetes requires the intake of medicine in addition to diet is very important. And all drugs that reduce the bad cholesterol should be used with a lower dose than that which is required for anti-diabetic drugs. As for the heart diseases, one need to reduce the intake of tobacco can reduce the risk of heart diseases. It is also necessary to reduce the amount of fat in the diet with the help of medicines such as statins, the need to reduce the fat percentage of unhealthy foods such as high-calorie, high-fat, fat rich food should be considered in addition to the diet.\nA recent study showed that even two weeks of a low calorie diet can reduce the rate of cardiovascular mortality in the elderly, this study used only a 20-week diet (that is, 20,000 calories per day).\nThere is evidence that suggests that increasing calorie intake increases lipid and decreases endothelial cell function and endothelial nitric oxide, which would be associated with changes in coronary heart disease. It is reported that the effect of calorie restriction on lipid metabolism increases in a double dose diet with no or low saturated fat. Therefore, in addition to the diets that have been tested with a high calorie intake, it may also be beneficial to have moderate carbohydrates with very low intake of fat, alcohol, and tobacco intake.\nThe study was conducted on over 4,000 patients and 6,184 participants (both male and female) of the Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Trial sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI).

What diet recommendations can John best be recommended to follow?\nJohn has a history of hypertension, diabetes, depression and obesity in his family. If he follows the guidelines of the NICE guidelines, how can John be managed to maintain his blood pressure and cholesterol levels and improve his total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increase his HDL cholesterol, reduce his blood pressure and improve his life expectancy?\nJA: The NICE guidelines offer guidance for the management of cardiovascular disease through population-based population-based guidelines. The guidelines are intended to enhance the quality of health services and the care of people with heart disease. The guideline recommendations should be used as a guide for the identification and management of patient populations. These should be based on the best evidence available at that time and should not be regarded as guidelines in their entirety. When using the guideline as a guide, it must be clearly stated that all the measures recommended cannot be undertaken in isolation, and additional measures should be considered. In particular, appropriate patient selection, patient-specific factors (e.g., age, comorbidities) and the role of genetic factors are not treated in isolation. All such considerations should be included in the risk assessment for each patient. If such consideration was not given, such recommendations are not considered as a good overall guideline, and if they were, they should be avoided.\nQ: How will John\u2019s lifestyle change because he is now using lifestyle changes (increasing exercise, quitting smoking, eating less processed foods, cutting down on alcohol, healthy, improved diet)? Will this change actually improve his life expectancy?\nJA: Lifestyle changes are probably the most important measures for improving the quality and length of life. It is important for John to follow these lifestyle changes and maintain them. These lifestyle changes are designed to decrease the risk for many important diseases, such as diabetes, and to improve their risk for cancer, and to delay the onset of a common age-related disease, such as heart disease. In addition to maintaining a healthy lifestyle for life, a healthy lifestyle is also one that improves overall health and health-related quality of life.\nQ: How do you think these lifestyle changes will affect John\u2019s life expectancy? Is there anything else John would need to do to improve his health?\nJA: There are some things that will improve health and improve the quality of life for people, but there are also some things that will not. Lifestyle changes are usually one and only approach, that ultimately does not change the overall environment of an individual\u2019s life. Lifestyle changes are not permanent and changes in lifestyle are generally temporary. However, lifestyle changes can have lasting effects and long-lasting impact on the quality of life for affected individuals. Lifestyle changes are therefore important to be looked into in order to make sure that the overall health of an individual and their lifestyle can be improved.\nQ: How will John\u2019s lifestyle change because he is now avoiding tobacco and not using alcohol?\nA: Changing to a new behaviour is not something that can be done overnight. It takes time and commitment to make these changes. Just because it is going to happen that John is not smoking does not mean that he is not going to smoke. For John, the best advice on changing his smoking is to avoid it, and to only smoke in moderation. For him, it is important to increase his consumption of exercise and eat a lower glycemic index diet. This will help John cut down on his risk for cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke and diabetes. For him, it would be interesting to improve his BMI and cholesterol levels, and to increase his physical activity. It is important to note that this is not the whole story. John is likely to have other risk factors that could affect his life expectancy, such as mental health or substance use.\nQ: What health risk factors did John\u2019s lifestyle change that would increase his cardiovascular and cancer mortality risk for life expectancy?\nA: John\u2019s lifestyle change was probably not good for his heart health. For a healthy-lifestyle approach, it is important to exercise regularly to maintain an average of at least 30 minutes at least five times a week with a minimum of 30 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity on most days of the week. In addition, to a healthy diet and to maintaining a healthy weight, it is important to do exercises and maintain an average daily or weekly sedentary time for at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity as an enjoyable task that will not put a strain on your body. For John, it was important to do a low fat or low saturated fat diet, and to maintain a healthy weight", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\nSophia Chikang, RN\nIn this case, the objective of the study was to assess cardiovascular risk factors (body mass index and BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol) and clinical signs of cardiac disease and to measure risk of heart attack, stroke or death from cardiovascular causes.\nThe sample were 5,286 people aged 50 years and older (80%.

A cuff attached to a small monitor made of a gold-plated brass or titanium wire approximately 1 cm on the arm. The cuff inflated to a minimum initial stroke volume of 37 mmhg. In the study, a continuous flow of blood from an in-line monitor was used to produce a cardiac output measurement.\n\u201cThe study of the results showed that blood pressure should be monitored continuously at baseline, regardless of a person\u2019s age, BMI or previous cardiovascular disease,\u201d said Professor Zhenan Bao, Senior Research Investigator at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who led the study.\n\u201cHowever, because it is an early study, the study is just a small part, but it provides a good foundation for what other studies do and how health professionals can take care of their patients to help reduce cardiac attacks that happen in the first place, said Bao, who is based at the He Zhi Hospital.\n\u201cIt can help people make an educated decision about their health, reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke, said Professor Jia Cai, Dean of the Department of Epidemiology at the NIIE, who led the study.\n\u201cWe are doing research on the effects of lifestyle changes, physical activity and weight reduction that may prevent atherosclerosis,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThis study suggests that the traditional Chinese way of eating is the best way to prevent cardiovascular diseases, which is a matter of great importance for the Chinese and the world \u2026 not only for China but also worldwide.\nHeart attacks can occur in any age group, but the occurrence increases with age, Bao said.\n\u201cThe data revealed two major factors: \u201ccardiovascular disease risk is higher in the Chinese \u2013 due to the high energy metabolism and lack of physical activity levels,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cIf the risk of heart attacks in the Chinese was lowered, in terms of lifestyle and disease prevention, people in China could avoid 78,000 heart attacks every year.\n\u201cThe Chinese eat a lot of pasta and rice, and consume a lot of meat and cheese, making them more likely to have diabetes and other heart diseases.\nThe results revealed that the Chinese are a long way from getting the message.\n\u201cBecause of the lack of Chinese education in China, fewer Chinese citizens are aware about the connection between health and lifestyle and the benefits of lifestyle and disease prevention, which can lead to lifestyle diseases,\u201d Bao said.", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\n1.

The previous doctor told me that, based on his history and examination, his AHA had been classified as high-risk, a risk higher than 1-standard deviations above the threshold. This diagnosis is wrong and I\u2019m not sure how to proceed. My father suffered from hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was a smoker and now I am the victim of a heart Attack because of his high cholesterol. What can be done to lower my cholesterol? How do you know his AHA was elevated?\u201d\nThis very difficult question was posed by Dr. Vittoria, both in the same clinical setting and in different contexts. She wanted to know what the problems were (in the past) and why it mattered to the patient so much.\nWith this in mind, I ask again:\n\u201cDear Dr. Vittoria, my father, 63 year old, was brought to your office yesterday morning, showing signs of serious illness and having symptoms of a myocardial infarction and heart attack. He had been smoking, has had very high cholesterol, hyperlipidemia, and has no history of a coronary artery disease. My father is considered low-fat-diet, so he is asking you to give him advice in managing these problems with a normal cholesterol level and a heart-disease risk of 2-standard deviations in a non-diabetic person.\u201dThe above question is just one of many that the cardiologist in the clinic asked. It was an opportunity to know what to ask the physician about these problems and what the patient meant.\n\u201cDear Dr. Vittoria, the heart disease diagnosis, or more accurately, what problems was he facing, was low-fat-diet. I do not know you, but the results so far have shown that your own smoking pattern is clearly correlated with your cholesterol. Your LDL was 13.5 mmol/L. Your HDL was about 4 mmol/L. You are 122 days pregnant, so your pregnancy history makes it easier for you to test your child\u2019s cholesterol. Your AHA level is 129.2 and your high density lipoprotein (HDL) is about 4.\nIt would be nice if your cholesterol level was high enough to cause you to have a heart attack but your AHA level is borderline high. You need more aggressive treatment, to avoid a myocardial infarction or a stroke.\u201d\nThis was a question I asked at the end of the first week of therapy for my father with a diagnosis of coronary artery heart failure and he had a bad low-fat-diet. The heart doctor\u2019s answer seemed to suggest a dangerous low-fat-diet as the cause. I asked questions for the next three weeks and the answers seemed to match the low-fat-diet advice from the doctor.\nThe above question was asked a year earlier in the same clinical setting and in the same context. For what it is worth, when the doctor asked a cardiac case, the answer was something like this:\n\u201cDear Dr. Vittoria and Dr. Izzi, in the clinic, I asked you to explain some of the problems that occurred and how your physician dealt with them correctly. We were told we had a very low-fat-diet history and had never had a heart attack and I am 100 percent confident that my HDL is within normal limits. We also asked you to explain the relationship between your high LDL levels and your coronary artery disease and how it is affecting your life. You do not look healthy. Your LDL is around 9.6 mmol/L and your HDL is about 4.2 mmol/L.\u201d\nHow long after your diagnosis, have you been taking drugs to control your high cholesterol? How does it affect your life?\nFrom the initial discussion, an interesting question arose here with respect", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?

An example of this might be done with Medicare beneficiaries.\nThere are many other examples. If they were to meet the criteria for heart disease in a similar situation to this patient, they may not meet the other criteria, for example if they are overweight (and therefore smoking), and would need to be evaluated. Or, if they are a 55 kg smoker (and hence have a low HDL cholesterol), they would need to be evaluated separately from a 54 kg smoker.\nAs a general rule the definition of heart disease is that 1 of the following 4 criteria are met for determining heart disease: Chest pain, Dyspnea, Peripheral Arterial Disease, or CHD, or as a general rule - A History of an event that might lead to an MI - and/or with Evidence of MI(s) in the past four years. They are listed below.\nChest Pain - This requires the physician to evaluate the time interval from experiencing the symptoms to the patient not being able to explain on time his or her diagnosis.\nSitting - Most patients suffering with severe heart failure have a great deal of difficulty walking or standing.\nDiabetic - Most people who have type 2 diabetes never have any evidence that they have had CVD, and are more likely to have been diagnosed with stroke.\nSmoking - If there is evidence of CVD, all of these patients will be evaluated separately, as defined above.\nThis is where we come to the point:\nWhat can the patient with this condition do to be evaluated separately? We can't, but there are many things that the patient can do. First, by being a \"strong advocate\" for their condition and educating themselves on their circumstances, they can potentially change the circumstance. Secondly, if they want to remain asymptomatic, by staying on their diet and exercise regimen, using medications to treat their underlying medical condition, avoiding smoking, and so on, that will change their situation and therefore their condition. This is something that can be done. And, if we are to assume, for a good reason, that there are no other medical conditions, that these patients can work out with each other and form relationships, then this is a good opportunity to change their condition.\nIf they cannot work out with each other or form a relationship, then they can seek the counsel of a cardiologist, possibly in the form of a cardiac rehabilitation specialist. There are few clinical programs that can be considered that will take all of their patients and their medical history and work out the medical condition separately from each other, which means that they should expect to have some difficulties, and thus, they will need to seek the aid of a cardiologist. But if they are going to be able to work out their situation, they probably should consider themselves to be in the best position to do so, in a way that works for most patients.\nSo, the point is that there is a great deal of research that has been done in this area so that the individual patient can be evaluated independently against the set of criteria which would be the definition of a heart disease. From this we know the extent of damage any patient will be inflicted upon themselves and their health, for example: Is there a high level of pain (of which many heart patients with high levels of pain are at risk of)? Is there an increased tendency to fall, or a tendency to stop breathing? Do patient's have difficulty following food/drink orders, or are they unable to perform at their usual level? Does their level of activity change, so that they do not get the most out of the day or week? Is there a lack of enjoyment in their life?, or is there a change in their physical and social relationships/activities?\nIn summary, from this research it can be stated that this group of patients are in the best position to work out their own situation, by working out their own health and disease. If this were a medical condition, then there would be little reason to want to go through life without hope. There are now heart disease interventions and services that are available in the US; these include things like 24 hour care centres, care home services, rehabilitation (if there are such, or to be used) where people can see someone at home through their mobile phone screen or the web; etc, etc, etc. These interventions would provide patients with a good deal of emotional", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\n|3||What are the common non-strenuous cardiorespiratory conditions associated with the greatest risks for heart disease||3|\n|4||What are the non-strenuous cardiorespiratory conditions associated with the greatest risks for coronary artery disease||3|\n|5||What are the non-frequent heart attacks seen in the community?

The first is controlling your hypertension, diabetes, and cholesterol, and two other things are a heart healthy diet and 100 percent exercise, according to the American Heart Association. The third thing that is important to control is being overweight. I recommend getting your body mass Index (BMI) under 24. The heart is sensitive to changes in muscle and fat, even if your body mass index remains normal. At this point, it is very reasonable and understandable to think that lowering your weight will lower your risk for heart disease.\nFor John, he has some things to be honest: He has a family which includes a smoker, he has taken anti-hypertension medications, and he has had regular exercise, but is still 43 years old and had heart attack in March, where that heart is probably more at risk that John\u2019s body mass index.\nWhat are his options at the next appointment?

It will help you see if the recommendations are reasonable.\nHere are some key things to consider\u2026.\nThere are five types of lipids in the human blood. The type and concentration of the lipid are determined by the number of components in a fatty acid chain.\n- Monoglycerides. M & D \u2013 1-2% and 5-8%\n- Triglycerides. TG \u2013 2-8% and 5-25%\n- Stokes Acid (SA) \u2013 9-16%\n- Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) \u2013 6.9-13.5%\n- High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) \u2013 5.0-7.4%\nThe fatty acids in the blood are not the only components in the fatty acid chain. There is a different kind of fatty acid that provides the basis for many cholesterol and lipids. It is called a phospholipidoacetate acid and is composed of a long chain of fatty acids linked with a 3-carbon glycerol backbone. The main constituents of phospholipids are phosphatidylcholine (Chol) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PPE). All proteins contain phospholipids. It is the hydrophilic component of the phospholipids that is responsible for the hydrophobic nature of some lipids (lipoproteins).\nIn addition to lipids and phospholipids, there are other components of the blood in the form of free fatty acids, monoglycerides, triacyglycerols (TAGs) and free fatty acids with monoacid in the form of small organic molecules, termed free fatty acids (FFAs). It is possible to have either triglycerides or monoglycerides (0.5% total and 0.5% TAGs). The difference between total triglycerides and TAGs is in their ratio of fatty acids with glycerol molecules.\nThe three components of the blood are very different and play different functions. They form the building block of many important lipids, such as cholesterol, sterols, triglycerides, phospholipids and free fatty acids. The difference in fatty acid composition has multiple biological, physiological and pathological functions. It is important to understand the importance of each component separately and to determine the implications for the proper function of plasma lipids.\nYour blood is composed of fats, usually triglycerides\nA simple calculation of the lipid ratio of cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, and free fatty. Acids (fatty acids) from the blood are the components of the central composition and the lipoproteins are the components to peripheral composition. The ratio of cholesterol has significant consequences for health and disease\nThe ratio or ratio, with which the ratios have a low proportion, has a greater importance in the maintenance of the various levels of the endocrine system and in the maintenance of cardiac health.\nFor many people, a normal or healthy ratio of cholesterol to fat causes health benefits.\nFor most people, a normal or healthy ratio of triglycerides to fatty acid will result in cholesterol balance. And for almost every individual, the ratio of triglycerides to fatty acids is of the lower or higher end. This is due to an increased absorption rate of dietary lipids.\nWhen triglyceride levels are lower than 1 mmol/L and triglyceride and fatty acid levels are high at the same time, their ratio is low. If there is no relationship with a lipid ratio, such as the triglyceride level at the same time, then there is some degree of relative excess.\nLow cholesterol levels are a sign of increased inflammation in the blood. When there is increased lipogenesis (production of fats inside the body) and lipolysis (breaking down of fatty acid in the body) it may be difficult to see a relationship between the ratio of cholesterol in the blood and total protein in the blood.\nAn increased ratio of triglycerides to other fat may require a low cholesterol diet, a reduction in alcohol intake (particularly red wine consumption), and improved nutrition. Eating adequate amounts of protein can also positively affect serum lipid and blood insulin levels.\nAn increase in phospholipids levels is usually a sign of increased vascular function. In many parts of the body, a decrease in phospholipids is associated with decreased vascular function.\nBlood lipid levels are a reflection of various endocrine and hormonal mechanisms.

What are their next steps?\nYour initial steps in this evaluation should be to work with your healthcare provider, ideally with the help of a dietitian, about a diet plan designed to assist to manage the symptoms of high cholesterol. This should involve regular heart health screening with blood tests and an updated reference blood pressure, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride level, as well as a discussion of other risk factors and changes you are making to decrease overall risks.\nYour healthcare provider will take note of whether you have cholesterol, blood pressure and diabetes or neither and then discuss them with you at the outset. This will allow that initial intervention focus to be on the specific ways of preventing heart disease from happening in the first place. A good plan will also give you a reference point to guide your future decisions, and your healthcare provider has to be available to answer any questions you might have about your cholesterol, blood pressure and diabetes over the rest of your life.\nA comprehensive lipid profile and lipid measurements will also be given under these conditions. You are asked to fill out self-declaration form and this will then be filled out by your healthcare provider in the appointment. This will form the basis for a specific diet plan so that you are also assessed for blood lipid parameters. You will also be closely closely monitored by a cardiovascular nurse expert (Cnoea) and a specialist dietitian (Dietetic Specialty Unit (DSU). The first objective is to make sure that your LDL cholesterol level remains consistently between 100 to 130 when you test at 2.5kg/cm2, then the highest when you test at 25kg/cm2. The next objective is to get your total cholesterol levels between 5mmol/L and 6.5mmol/L, then the lowest after reaching 5mmol/L.\nWhen we eat, the body releases various hormones into our bloodstream which tell the pancreas to release energy stores to supply needed energy to our cells. If we are not eating enough carbohydrates, fat, protein and water, the body stores these energy stores for our cells to be able to use when we need them. But when we consume carbohydrates rich foods for example carbohydrates of a low glycemic index (GI) food, our body will burn through these stored energy stores efficiently, giving us ample energy to meet our needs throughout the day.\nOn the other hand, when there is a higher level of excess glucose (sugar) in our blood, then our body stores the glucose in our liver, the main storage part of the body. This is why there are several medical conditions related to this sugar accumulation, such as Type 1 and 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes mellitus often develops in people who are overweight or obese. Obesity is closely associated with high blood pressure, high blood sugar, elevated cholesterol, and high blood triglycerides. Obesity and diabetes both cause many health problems in the skin, bones, blood vessels, and nerve, muscle, and soft tissue diseases.\nIn obesity, excess fat deposits can be stored in the abdomen and thighs, which can cause problems such as increased body fat, reduced range of motion and reduced joint flexibility. Excess fat cells can stimulate the release of insulin into the bloodstream, which means that the body cells will not be able to use glucose and will rather use the fat stores in the abdominal area. This can cause metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart diseases.\nThis condition is a combination of abnormal deposition of fat in the stomach and pancreas. These fatty deposits can be easily removed, but they may stay there for a long time as they stay in the organ, which can cause problems when they are broken down by the body, affecting the health of the organ.\nType 2 diabetes mellitus is a result of the body cells developing insulin resistance. Insulin is a hormone which is secreted to transport glucose or sugar to the cells where the glucose can be absorbed directly into cells for energy. Insulin is used in individuals with diabetes, so the body does not make enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. In this way, excess fat cells collect sugars and glucose in the blood and cause these cells to be starved for energy. The higher that body fat level, the harder these cells are to get enough energy from the glucose.\nDiabetes mellitus results from the conversion of an inactive, normal amount of fat in the body into insulin. A combination of these processes means that a person with diabetes is more likely than someone without diabetes to develop the condition. The pancreas is unable to release insulin, so levels are usually too high there. This can increase blood glucose to the point of causing other serious", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\n10 mg/3 milliliter of 0.1% oxygen\n10 mg/0.5 milliliter of 0.1% oxygen\n9 mg/10 milliliter of 0.1% oxygen\n5 mg/20 milliliter of 0.2% oxygen\n15 mg/15 milliliter of 0.2% oxygen\n(see Table 1)\nThere is a good possibility that this blood mixture is too dry, although we are now aware this is not the case. It is unlikely that we will achieve the levels we need for a successful stroke, for example. However, our heart rate at rest at various times throughout the day will fluctuate, and if this is more accurately measured by an electrocardiogram, it is much too low to induce these blood changes. We may also have other irregular patterns, but our ability to keep a constant heart rate is likely to be lower than it should be, perhaps because our normal cardiorespiratory routine does not suit us. We also may have an irregular resting ECG, with one of the following characteristics:\nA rhythm (pulse at the heart rate is shorter than it should be)\nIncomplete sinus rhythm\nA heartbeat with an irregular beat\nLow sinus heart rate\nA sinus rhythm pattern with a greater period of sinus rhythm\nA heartbeat with an irregular beat\nA sinus rhythm with a shorter amplitude\nWith such patterns, where is the difference?\nWe can think of more than one stroke, but a stroke only occurs when the blood supply to the brain has been impaired. In an area where the blood supply is diminished, there is more time for damage to occur to the brain, and we can expect the blood supply there to be very poor, as it is often too dry. This would lead to a number of changes on the ECG:\nThe number of nerve cells in the brain is reduced (\u2018myelin\u2019)\nThe supply of oxygen to the brain is reduced (\u2018circulatory depression')\nIncreased cardiac output (\u2018cardiac output\u2019)\nWhen this is a short period of a sinus rhythm pattern, the ECG is said to be normal. We might also be able to see a large number of abnormal heart sounds (\u2018atriosphegoes') during different parts of the ECG. Our doctor may also be able to be seen seeing the atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter that we also have.\nOnce again, we have been limited by the difficulty with measuring these situations, but it is possible to tell that something is seriously damaged, such as heart strokes. A high heart rate is clearly seen. We have not been able to measure the number of strokes, but we can see that a stroke can be a severe heart problem, and that it is a much different kind of stroke.\nIt is thought that a stroke may cause damage that is irreversible, like when a tumour makes you go blind. Even with surgery to correct the condition, in a stroke, the blood that has carried the diseased tissue with oxygen is then lost, because the area around the stroke is blocked and oxygenated blood cannot re-route to the brain at the same speed it was used at the time of the original flow.\nIn an irreversible case, the brain is not able to get oxygen and nutrients back to the brain. When this happens, the brain cells cease to function and are quickly lost, like the brain cells in a \u2018shock\u2019. We may suffer from a stroke for a long time.\nWith these changes, our doctor will have a greater difficulty in detecting strokes in a fast acting pulse in the person we are treating. If a heart attack is suspected and the symptoms are unclear, the first thought is to investigate the problem further. An electrocardiogram can confirm the problem but not rule out heart attacks. In people experiencing chest pain, the ECG will show that the heart rate has been increased. If the ECG is still negative as to the diagnosis, this indicates that an abnormal heart rhythm is present.\nIn patients with a significant stroke, the ECG should suggest further investigations if these may be required. The most common way is for a doctor to diagnose a heart defect.

In the event that you do have heart failure, for instance, this may mean having to be discharged from hospital or receiving a cardiac catheterisation before any further steps can be taken.\nAlso, some cardiac conditions in particular may affect CVD prevention, such as hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), angina, pericardial effusion or coronary spasm. While you may still be diagnosed with either of these conditions, there may be other ways to prevent CVD including; lifestyle changes such as appropriate weight and body condition monitoring, regular health visits and cholesterol levels, aspirin therapies, ACE inhibitors, statins, lifestyle changes, blood pressure control, the use of regular cardiovascular screening tests for anyone at risk, medication use, and the monitoring and adjustment of the medication dosage.\nIn terms of your current treatment approach, NICE guidelines are strongly recommended for those with high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, or a high risk of heart failure:\n- Those affected by cardiovascular diseases and those on a prescription heart drug or otherwise need to take control of their risk by managing their cholesterol by a reasonable dose of medication and lifestyle factors such as a healthy diet, regular physical exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, and weight loss.\n- Those affected by cardiovascular diseases and heart failure and who are not capable of taking medication, such as in the hospital, need to be assessed by a general practitioner to find out whether or not you are suffering from any underlying or systemic conditions that need to be addressed. For instance, if you are a diabetic, your blood pressure and cholesterol levels should be controlled, and any other conditions such as kidney disease or diabetes may need to be managed.\n- Those affected by cardiovascular diseases and heart failure and who are no longer able to seek medical help or treatment by themselves, may need to rely on the services of a local hospital to diagnose them and set them up or assist them in determining the condition of their hearts.\n- Those affected by cardiovascular diseases and heart failure and who are no longer able to seek medical help or treatment by themselves, may find it necessary to rely on the services of a local hospital to diagnose them and set them up or assist them in determining the condition of their hearts.\nFor further information, see the full NICE Guideline for management of coronary heart disease by general practitioners: http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg0000002-f01a8e7d-vb1-4bd6df551e0d2/", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\nNHS (24 October 2021)\nHow does naltrexone relate to the NHS?\nNaltrexone is used for the treatment of alcohol dependence and its co-use as part of a dual diagnosis treatment. Alcohol use disorder can affect several areas of a person's life. Naltrexone is a medication typically used to treat alcohol dependence. It is a synthetic compound that blocks the brain's receptors that facilitate the brain's response to alcohol. Naltrexone targets the brain's receptors, blocking the effects and withdrawal of alcohol. Naltrexone works by binding to the opiate receptors in the brain and stopping the effects of alcohol and its related drugs. As a result, the drug is sometimes known as Tranquilizing Drug.\nIn 2011, NICE published its opinion that naltrexone had not shown to be'substantially effective in reducing the impact of long-term substance use without diminishing treatment effectiveness.' NICE recommends that naltrexone should not be used for the treatment of alcohol dependence unless the individual's condition is stable. The UK Government has committed 20% of its 70-year-old population to treatment and naltrexone is therefore not recommended for the treatment of alcohol dependence. naltrexone is currently only recommended in certain contexts for the treatment of alcoholism and other alcohol dependence conditions. NICE now considers naltrexone to be the single best choice for treatment for moderate or mild alcohol dependence.\nNICE (2021)\nSummary of NICE guidelines on use of naltrexone with respect to treating alcohol dependence:\nThis document summarises NICE guidance on the best choice for use of naltrexone with respect to treating alcohol dependence. Its aim is to encourage prescribers to use naltrexone at the appropriate stage, which is not currently being measured.\nSummary of NICE review of the evidence of benefits of naltrexone for patients with alcohol dependence:\nThe NICE reviewed of NICE guideline on the use of naltrexone with respect to treating alcohol dependence:\nThis review focuses on prescribing naltrexone to help manage alcohol intake patterns in patients who develop alcohol-related distress. It draws together the current evidence and describes the guidelines that prescribe naltrexone for patients experiencing alcohol dependence.\nNICE (2002)\nWhy naltrexone shows to be'very effective in reducing alcohol dependence and drinking of other substances by 40-50% in alcohol dependent patients at 3 months'\nThis guidance from the American Society of Addiction Medicine reviews evidence on the effectiveness of naltrexone in reducing alcohol dependence (AD). Its aim is to encourage prescribers to use naltrexone at the appropriate stage, which is not currently being measured.\nAlthough naltrexone is a potential therapy for a number of conditions, including alcohol dependence and substance abuse, it is one of only a few 'effective' combinations of drugs that can be used for this reason. The evidence from the scientific literature on the safety and effectiveness of naltrexone is particularly strong.\nNHS Clinical Trials Information (April 2022)\nThis advice from DrugBank describes the safe dosing for naltrexone.\nThis advice from MSD (2022)\nThis advice from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) describes the safety and effectiveness of naltrexone for the treatment of alcoholism.", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\nIt is crucial to keep in mind that risk factors, when combined and presented as a comprehensive model, can be a guiding factor in a patient's overall treatment. Using a holistic approach to NICE's strategy, Dr. Lee would emphasize the importance of a comprehensive approach, utilizing all relevant features of the NICE model and considering the specific needs and preferences of the individual patient.\nBy integrating the NICE model's principles within the context of the specific case of a 70-year-old Chinese man, it becomes possible to provide a tailored and effective approach to patient care in the context of health risk factors.\nThis article was first published in the November 2019 issue of American Journal of Surgery.\nWritten by Dr. Kim Chae, CVO; Dr. Kim Choi, CVS, VAD, CCO, CNP, CNBC\nSource Credits: Medical News Today", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention? We found that some recommendations would not apply to any of the above risks, so NICE is not recommending lifestyle therapy to prevent CVD.\nBut what about those who are not in a position to make appropriate lifestyle changes to change or maintain their heart health and still have CVD? Is there a guideline for what lifestyle changes would be appropriate for a patient with CVD? According to NICE guidelines, lifestyle changes for any of the above CVD risk factors must be assessed in conjunction with other factors for cardiovascular risk. A patient at risk of CVD would make lifestyle changes to reduce cardiovascular risk, at the same time they would reduce their level of CVD risk. The difference between these two are the extent of lifestyle changes, and the proportion of lifestyle changes would be sufficient to reduce CVD risk.\nSo, for instance, one might have an atherosclerotic heart disease, high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes and so on, but some lifestyle behaviors such as maintaining a healthy body mass index, exercise, not drinking alcohol, have been proven to be associated with a lower risk of CVD. If you have an HbA1C less than 5.3%, you can still improve your CVD risk, but if you have diabetes, smoking, hyperlipidaemia or hypertension, you should make all steps in the lifestyle to be taken under these circumstances, so they can be considered part of the current NHS recommendations.\nSo, it seems sensible that a patient at risk of CVD may be in need of lifestyle changes, but it doesn't have to follow these guidelines. In fact, they may not even be in the position required to implement these changes, so we might need to use more discretion in terms of what type of changes are appropriate in the patient's particular situation.\nThe above guidance for lifestyle modification in the UK is provided by the UK's National Health Service (NHS). It does not have an SNH guideline, but it has some guidance for healthcare professionals.\nIf you have hypertension or hypercholesterolemia please make those lifestyle changes, if you have diabetes you want them to be in the same category. Lifestyle is only one part of CVD prevention and it's important to be able to identify at what point they started to do the above lifestyle changes.\nLet us know what changes you suggest in 5 Minutes or less:\nOr, if you prefer emailing, feel free to write me at [email protected] or [email protected] or [email protected].

He explains that the research highlights the importance of nutrition and exercise for individuals with high risk of CVD. He explains that diet and exercise alone cannot overcome the risk factors for CVD, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, but can decrease their impact and lead to a healthier lifestyle.\nSeth also shares an opinion from a patient when asked if he would have any lifestyle changes that he would be able to make and the extent that he would have made at the time. The patient says that he would have given up smoking, stopped drinking alcohol, quit smoking", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention? Are there any questions regarding what risk factor for CVD may influence lifestyle adjustments that would limit the risk of CVD? The answer to these questions will directly impact the development of an effective CVD intervention.\nThis topic has important implications for patient safety, health literacy and the public health infrastructure in our country. Patients with CVD often have other health issues that are not adequately addressed through healthy lifestyle modifications, such as excessive alcohol consumption, diabetes, obesity, smoking, and poor nutrition. In this way, patients are at a higher risk for adverse outcomes. If patients have CVD, this is a time-consuming and costly intervention, whereas if they do not have CVD, this is not that time consuming and a great risk reduction benefit.\nAwareness, understanding the influence of lifestyle modification on the risk of CVD among the general public, may have a large public health impact. For example, if all Chinese citizens had a balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, whole grain cereals, lean protein, and dairy products, CVD risk would be reduced by 1.69 (P=0.001),1 that is equivalent to lowering CVD risk to the 65% threshold. Given that only 2.8% of Chinese citizens will be considered at risk based on BMI, the overall proportion of Chinese citizens with CVD is only 0.7%. However, it would be prudent for the public to have greater access to public health resources like schools and clinics, which may increase the proportion of those with moderate CVD or CVD+1.1\nWe have reviewed data on the relationship between lifestyle modification and CVD risk from the literature. A greater proportion of the population should have a balanced diet, particularly fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, dairy products, legumes, tofu, soybeans, and fish products to improve their risk of CVD, especially in China and Southeast Asia.4 The overall proportion of Chinese citizens with CVD is 0.7%.1 But, not enough will ever be achieved to improve CVD morbidity and mortality in China.3,4 A national government may need to increase resources and invest the necessary funds in public health infrastructure such as hospitals, clinics, and wellness centers. Public awareness campaigns and education on healthy lifestyle choices will play a significant role in decreasing CVD-related deaths, particularly in China.4\nWe also have reviewed data on the relationship between lifestyle modification and physical activity from the literature. A greater proportion of people with CVD will be active, particularly in Asian countries.5 Even more importantly, the overall proportion of Chinese citizens with CVD is 0.6%15 which means 65% of China's rural population will be active.6 The benefits of exercise and weight loss in reducing CVD will be great in China.6 However, the results for China are not always the same. For example, in the United States, only a minority of Asian adults and younger adults are overweight or obese, which is likely to lead to more sedentary lifestyles for the population.6 Other regions of the United States are more likely to adopt the Healthy Active Living (HA) guidelines. For instance in Connecticut only about 10% of the population is obese.\nOne possible limitation of the above review is the small sample sizes. The general public may benefit from the increased intake of fruit, vegetables, and low-salt and low-fat dairy products due to greater sodium intake from sodium additives, which makes it difficult to ascertain their effect on CVD.3,4\nAs this review highlights, the relationship between lifestyle modification and CVD has long been established, but more research is needed to better integrate this knowledge into public health policies and programs. These findings also point to an urgent need for more health education on nutrition and exercise among the public.\n- The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 2020.

It should be noted that NICE guidelines only apply to public health actions that have been previously assessed as having the potential for effectiveness, and that can influence health services in the absence of these actions.\nIn summary, there was little evidence-based guidance addressing cardiovascular prevention, but some guidance about blood pressure and diabetes prevention was provided, and more attention should be given to the effects of smoking and alcohol on CVD risk. Recommendations focused on smoking cessation, lowering high blood pressure, reducing hypercholesterolemia, addressing dyslipidaemia, and controlling blood sugar and glucose levels. However, there was insufficient knowledge about strategies to reduce smoking, and a need for more evidence-based guidance was identified with regard to smoking cessation, which should be given due importance in the future. There also needs to be updated guidance for hypertension.\nWhat are the major findings of NICE guidelines on cardiovascular risk on CVD prevention?\nThe main findings of NICE guidelines on CVD prevention are as follows:\n|Age over 65 years||Blood pressure|\n|BMI > 25, BMI 30 and BMI > 30 at stroke||\n|Diabetes < 18yrs||Blood pressure|\n|No prior diabetes|\n|BMI > 25 and > 31|\n|No smoking||\n|No smoking as a smoking cessation recommendation?|\n|No blood pressure cuff use||\n|No diabetes and no smoking\n|No blood sugar and glucose monitoring|\n|There is no need for additional information on risk factors other than age and high blood pressure|\nThe most important finding of NICE guidelines on cardiovascular risk on CVD prevention is the importance of smoking cessation. NICE guidance says that smoking cessation is an important element in reducing the risk of developing a patient with CVD. The evidence in these guidelines, if based upon quality of evidence, shows that people who have quit smoking are at a 12 per cent reduced risk of a patient diagnosed with CVD.\nWhat advice on risk factors is the NICE guidance relevant for?\nNICE guidance on cardiovascular risk has been well established and documented. There are 3 main factors that should be considered:\n\u25cf Smoking cessation and behavioural measures alone do not necessarily ensure risk reduction of CVDs among non-smokers. A range of behavioural interventions is required when providing prevention interventions in non-smoking people.\n\u25cf If you are a smoker, a smoking cessation intervention should not be the first recommendation on preventive programme but an important element in the subsequent programmes designed for this population. A smoking cessation intervention should take place in conjunction with a low cholesterol diet.\n\u25cf To determine the relative importance of each of the two risk factors alone, the aim would be to demonstrate whether the use of a smoking cessation intervention is better than no intervention at all.\nWith regards to behavioural measures, NICE advice is that if people who are at high risk do not smoke then the risk that they are at risk of CVDs should be significantly reduced. However, there are potential limitations:\n\u25cf If you have one high risk cardiovascular disease (such as a cardiovascular disease or coronary heart disease) then the use of behavioural interventions is not recommended when providing prevention interventions for that CVD.\n\u25cf If you have another high risk cardiovascular disease (such as a cardiovascular disease or coronary heart disease) then the use of behavioural interventions is recommended when providing prevention interventions for that CVD, but there is potential for a risk that some of the benefit from those interventions could also be seen in reducing the risk of CVDs among those who are at low risk. For this purpose the interventions should be adjusted accordingly.\n\u25cf The use of behavioural techniques itself is of important importance for preventing future CVDs. Some of the factors influencing the practice of the use of behaviourist techniques can result in poor adherence to the programme.\n\u25cf In some cases, if the patients are at high risk of CVDs but not yet diagnosed, then behavioural interventions should be used for prevention programme.\n\u25cf The use of high impact behavioural interventions, such as smoking cessation, is not essential in the first years of the CVD prevention programme. With the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease in younger people, it is recommended to use a combination of behavioural interventions and lifestyle factors when providing the CVD prevention programme.\nWhat evidence is to be expected?\nThere is evidence that smoking behaviour increases, although the number of studies related to quitting is relatively small, and evidence is generally not strong. There have been few randomised controlled trials.

The guideline is called \u2018Prevention of Heart Disease and Stroke in the United Kingdom: Current guidelines for treatment and control\u2019. It also recommends the following interventions:\n- Lifestyle, including a low-fat diet, physical exercise and stress management\n- Smoking cessation\n- Calcium and vitamin D supplementation.\nThe guideline is also important for prevention of coronary heart disease, stroke in people with diabetes and blood pressure. It recommends stopping diabetes or other conditions that cause high blood pressure soon after the NHS diagnosis, as it is a major cause of heart disease.\nIt will now be in the public sector as part of the NHS's National Screening Programme, allowing it to start screening for heart disease.\nThe NHS does not recommend a lifestyle to prevent heart disease, so the UK-led expert group agreed that lifestyle may not be the sole intervention to prevent heart disease. It also agreed that lifestyle recommendations are only part of the overall approach that includes weight loss and blood pressure control.\nAccording to the NICE guidance:\n\u201cHeart disease is a leading cause of death, accounting for 1 in 4 deaths. Although many people are aware of the risks associated with heart disease, they may not recognize that lifestyle factors can put their heart at risk of disease.\n\u201cIt is important to recognise that lifestyle choices, while potentially harmful in very small parts, have far-reaching benefits that can reduce the risk of heart disease in everyday life.\n\u201cThe UK recommends that lifestyle changes can help to reduce the risk of heart disease, but is not a standard of treatment. The recommended lifestyle changes include, for example, reducing salt intake, increasing physical activity, quitting smoking, and taking cholesterol medicines if you are diagnosed with a cardiac or metabolic disease.\u201d", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?

It also recommends screening for and treating at risk individuals with early signs of CVD, and the person should be counselled to consider their risk as a person rather than a risk for CVD prevention.\nHeart failure (HF) describes systolic dysfunction and diastolic dysfunction in the absence of evidence of coronary artery disease. HF is the most common form of heart failure and it may cause a progressive and difficult course, with mortality rates up to 80%. Despite the large burden of HF, little information exists regarding risk factors for heart failure.\nThe most relevant risk factors are family history for heart failure or previous episodes of heart failure, prior heart attack, myocardial infarct, previous heart failure exacerbations, or any condition that increases the risk for heart failure or myocardial infarction in at least one of the two of the following circumstances:\n\"heart failure has been associated with risk factors for hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, obesity, smoking, alcohol consumption, stress, age, stress, diet, lack of physical activity, chronic liver and kidney disease, and other factors\"\nThe best strategy to reduce the risk of heart failure is to stop smoking, reduce alcohol consumption, control weight, avoid stress, limit unhealthy diet choices, avoid chronic infection, and maintain a healthy active lifestyle.\n- Heart failure is a life-long condition and most patients have to adapt to the changes and limitations of a major organ.\n- Heart disease is the most common cause of death leading to more than 2 million people dying per year and costs over ten billion dollars per year\n- Many people experience moderate or severe symptoms of heart failure\n- There is no known cure\n- There are treatments available for people with mild stages of heart failure\nThis may sound like a daunting task, but the British Heart Foundation explains that there is no single test for heart failure according to the Heart Foundation\u2019s guidelines:\n\"it is very important that doctors, nurses, and other health care workers know what to look for as they try to diagnose or rule out possible causes of symptoms like chest pain\"\nThe results of your test or examination or evaluation can help your doctor diagnose a heart failure. Doctors will want to check three general things like:\n- How well your heart pumps blood\n- How well that heart is pumping blood, and\n- how well the heart controls itself.\nHowever, these tests and evaluations may take longer and more time to take place because certain diseases like diabetes, heart failure, and diabetes that are currently being monitored as risk factors for heart failure.\nThere are also limitations when it comes to taking the test that you may have. Some of the tests will only be able to evaluate just one organ or system, while others can evaluate the entire heart and include the organ, and it can take 6-8 hours, 34-48 hours, 6 months, 9 months or more to receive a conclusive diagnosis for heart failure.\n- The results of your test or examination or evaluation can help your doctor diagnose a heart failure. Dr. Jordi Alcantari, the lead specialist at the UK\u2019s Royal College of Radiology, says that these tests and investigations typically take 15-25 minutes. You will be able to leave your home or workplace and walk to a nearby hospital for the test.\n- It may take an hour, 1 hour, and more, than an hour for the results to come back out.\n- It takes approximately 10-15 hours for your results to be sent to the lab, as well.\nThere are a number of things you can do to help reduce your risk of heart failure:\n1. Try to adopt a healthier lifestyle, such as:\n- exercising once or twice a week as much as possible\n- eating a healthy diet that is low in saturated fat\n- eating 5 servings of fruit and vegetables daily\n- limiting your sugar intake\n- reducing stress\n- eating small frequent meals throughout the day\n- improving sleep habits\n- avoiding alcoholic drinks and tobacco use\n- managing stress and anxiety\n- avoiding over-active thyroid\n- avoiding too much caffeine or alcohol consumption\n- maintaining a healthy weight\n2.

If there is a focus on these areas, it would be helpful to highlight how well they fit into NICE's guidelines.\n\n4. **Is there more to heart health than just preventing disease?\n\nTo effectively tackle cardiovascular risk factors, it's essential to address both modifiable (non-modifiable) and risk factors (modifiable). For example, maintaining a healthy BMI through healthy eating and not smoking could significantly reduce your risk of CVD. Similarly, managing cholesterol levels through lifestyle changes or medications can help manage hypertension, a common contributing factor in heart disease. Regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight can also contribute to reducing risk factors.\n\nBy clearly defining and communicating these health policies and key recommendations, health professionals can effectively provide comprehensive resources to those at risk for CVD and encourage people to take charge of their own heart health.", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recognises that there is limited consensus on the optimal approach of the NHS and its plans when it comes to CVD risk factors. As such, there is considerable variability in current practice across both central and peripheral settings.\nThe most recent NICE consensus opinion on CVD risk assessment (published in 2017) sets out five key questions that can be used to assess the risks associated with CVD:\n- Cardiovascular disease (CVD) - in a person with a pre-existing CVD condition such as coronary heart disease or a family history of CVD, or one who is taking medications which might contribute to CVD, or who has diabetes and is overweight, it is considered important to assess the risks associated with CVD via identifying those at higher risk.\n- Tobacco (Tobacco) - is part of a wider tobacco risk assessment. It can be used alongside CVD risk assessment (such as blood fats, blood pressure, and cholesterol) in order to identify any tobacco-related risk factors. It is not recommended for anyone with an inherited condition, such as diabetes, who is taking lifestyle-oriented therapies or who has a limited-risk risk of tobacco exposure due to family history or history of smoking. It is not recommended for anyone with other risk factors that don't lead to TEF (such as being overweight and poor diet); for example, it is not recommended for people who are under 45 years old and have a reduced risk of being overweight or being in an older age group.\n- Physical activity - is part of a broader physical activity risk assessment. It is not recommended for anybody with an inherited condition, such as diabetes or high cholesterol. It is not recommended for anyone with other risk factors that don't lead to physical inactivity such as being overweight and poor diet; for example, it is not recommended if a person has only recently started a vigorous training programme.\n- Personal history of CVDs or other risk factors (eg smoking, family history of CAD or other risk factors for diabetes, heart failure, or any other condition that increases CVD risk) - is used to identify the individual's highest risk for developing CVD. It is not advised for anyone with a family history or condition for which there is either no obvious explanation, such as pre-existing heart disease or a history of myocardial infarction, high LDL- and low HDL-C levels, or high BP over the last 5 years, among other reasons. It is not recommended for anyone with a history of hypertension, diabetes, or any other condition that increases CVD risk.\n- Socioeconomic status (eg high poverty level) - is used to identify a person's best place for living to take precautions to lower their risk of CVD.\nNICE guidance also suggests some changes around the current guidelines, such as:\n- Some NICE guidelines for CVD risk assessment currently state that people should receive a single card containing the person's full risk factors that could be used for CVD risk assessment. This is because it is perceived that the card does not include information about the overall risk of the individuals and rather provides them with a summary of risk factors for any particular risk indicator.\n- Another important change is to ensure that other measures (such as weight, diet, exercise, blood pressure, and cholesterol) are given equal priority.\nWith all these new guidelines, how should the individual or cohort care and support be organised?\nNICE and its own national working group (NQF-NICE and NICE Clinical Guidelines Working Group) has developed a toolkit, called NICE Evidence, to assist with the task of deciding what a person might be able to do to decrease their CVD risk.\nThe toolkit, which is currently being used within England and Wales and provides practical recommendations in a few key areas, includes:\n- Advice on how to help reduce the risk for people with a particular underlying risk factor, such as a family history or cholesterol level in the blood. It also gives useful guidelines for working with people with an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism).\n- Guidance on how to support people with low muscle strength or balance, who carry little weight in everyday life.\n- Advice that will help people to control their blood pressure and cholesterol and that can be useful when trying to cut down or cut back on smoking.

And in a country as large as Australia, people have to change as well. No one should live their lives in fear of a cardiovascular event.\u201d\nThe researchers say that the study\u2019s findings will help to refine what the guidelines recommend for prevention of CVD in Australia.\nThe findings have to be accepted and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, an editorial published by The BMJ, which is an authoritative medical organisation.\nProf Rotherham said:\n\u201cThe research adds to the evidence base on lifestyle interventions for both heart and vascular disease and provides a strong scientific basis for people to adopt lifestyle modification. In particular, the findings are encouraging for these communities that, especially in men, physical activity may provide protection against coronary artery disease, the most common and deadly form of CVD.\u201d\nProf Robert Mandell, Director of Public Health at the University of Melbourne, said:\n\u201cI think the fact that more Australians take on a physical activity and diet advice from health professionals will be more effective at preventing cardiovascular disease than most other prevention strategies such as smoking and heavy drinking\u2026 I think that\u2019s an appropriate and important line of health advice\u2026 that we all play a part in reducing health care costs. I\u2019m very interested to hear about what the new recommendations for CVD prevention in Australia say.\u201d", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\nThe majority of adults in the UK have been recognised as overweight or obese by NHS guidelines (ie, BMI 25 or higher), meaning they have an average of 33.6 kgs (790lbs) of excess weight.\nIf we were to assume they would all be normal weight in the same time period (i.e., no change in their BMI), we'd see an increase in heart disease as that part of the UK population is living longer from the age of 66 years.\nHowever, as all of the above variables are measured in the first three years, this has to change to give a reasonable expectation when interpreting the findings.\nThe number 1 thing that comes to mind when it comes to heart disease in the UK is the weight of the first three years of life - and it's the same thing is the percentage of children on the UK National Health Service, even if they don't have to worry about it. It might be more important to assess if children live as long as adults, as they may not be living as long as that age group due to weight maintenance.\nA good question is then to ask whether they are living a healthier lifestyle overall, if they are being overweight, or whether they are currently in poor physical condition; if they now seem to be more fit than when they were in the initial stage, or if that is the only result they are looking for.\nWhat is your heart disease risk? Does it come down to your genetics? More importantly, what would be the impact of living in a country where you are considered overweight, and the impact on your overall health if you are healthy overall?\nThe National Heart Foundation is working hard to implement the NICE guidelines based on the UK methodology, using the National Health Service. How this works is simple. NICE is the UK's primary medical advice service, and is the UK equivalent of a'state health department'. When healthcare professionals look at a patient, they first want to make sure they have checked in on their overall wellbeing: if they are fit, healthy, and healthy as a matter of course, they'll then consider how they can be further strengthened when they're ill (as long as they are healthy as a matter of course).\nThe aim of NICE in this way will be to be able to make sure that NHS teams know more about what's going right and what is not and are able to make the right adjustments. Once you take into account BMI-adjusted risks for each age group and look at their overall health, and then their BMI, then it's much easier to see that someone or something is causing such significant problems. The key point is that if you have an illness that doesn't have to involve your heart, then most likely these things are less troublesome, since if you have a lifestyle that's more healthy, then it's likely that your BMI would be slightly better, allowing you to progress to the top risk category.\nNICE recommendations now go out to more people, and more importantly what they need to do to improve their lives.\nHow do you think they'd change to meet NICE guidelines in the UK?", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\n- As a general practitioner who has seen the majority of patients with high cholesterol, I believe it's best to start preventative measures when the patient is young as a first step. My practice would be more appropriate to be part of the public health roll-out plan for the development if any further preventative measures.\n- Although the main concern for CVD prevention is weight management, NICE also recommends a reduction of intake of saturated fats and increasing intake of unsaturated fats.\n- Given that LDL cholesterol is the most readily accessible form of artery-clogging fat yet it is an essential component in lipid storage and transport, it is clear that reducing cholesterol intake will be beneficial in decreasing risk.\n- In light of the recommendation, I would recommend patients aiming to decrease LDL cholesterol intake by increasing intake of unsaturated fats and increasing intake of polyunsaturated fats.\n- While maintaining intake of saturated fats, there is currently no evidence that reducing cholesterol intake has any impact on preventing CVD. We need to work with the health professionals and government agencies who have the authority to make decisions in terms of preventing CVD and their recommendations are the best option. There are also some limitations of NICE guidelines. For example, in a randomised controlled study in China, it is not clear with regards to the role of the diet in reduction of cholesterol, that the diet itself reduces LDL cholesterol (as an assumption in the intervention phase) or not reducing cholesterol intake. This could also be an issue with the population rather than with interventions, as studies investigating the impact of dietary intervention on cholesterol have shown conflicting results.\nIf you would like to discuss this topic further, please get in touch:\nSenior Dietetic Fellow, Imperial College London, University of Manchester (BSc in Clinical Nutrition)\nTania Rathore, Senior Dietetic Fellow and Director of London\u2019s International Network for Nutrition, Diabetes, Health and Ageing (INNH) (BSc Nutrition Sciences), Professor (University of Bristol)\n1.

To avoid any problems with using guidelines, get a new guideline or two based on guidelines in the literature.

The other guidelines for people with heart disease will be needed afterwards.\n\n2. The guideline for a patient who has an active case of chronic non-communicable disease is not to use the guidelines found as a guide in the literature.

Jenna,\n\nNo, it's not important because I understand the underlying principles, and you're in control here on this thread. Just because you believe that some guidelines are important, that doesn't mean they are. Your example would make that a valid consideration.\n\nIt's quite reasonable that patients with a history of CAD be treated differently than patients without a history of CAD, so there needs to be a discussion about what type of people need a different guideline than others.\n\nThere is a reason why they have different guidelines for all these groups. Let's not allow the same generic guideline to apply to everyone under it. I've got a group to check a patient for risks and complications.\n\nGood luck!\n\nLast edited: Feb 3, 2016\n2. John,\n\nIn your \"what are these guidelines\" post, I would like to say that it would be prudent for John to not get a new guideline until after he is cleared by the National Institute of Health or National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. I have no idea what he got from those groups, but you don't need one in order to give him this information. Your \"guidelines\" are probably written before he gets his clinical care recommendations! They are very general and don't mention anything specific about an individual patient's risk. You were saying to John, if you want to write the guidelines, you would:\n\nA) Take a look at the latest guidelines from the American Heart Association and British Heart Foundation\n\nB) Review the resources on the NHS and the US Preventive Services Taskforce websites.\n\nE) Write your own guidelines.\n\nI would put down a generic guideline as John needs that. Don't make anything too specific to his situation. Do what John needs.\n\n3. John,\n\nI thought that by asking and reading a doctor's recommendations in the past year or so it is likely to be a good guideline in practice.\n\nI wasn't able to see any guidance from the NHS in regard to heart disease; but I know there are some guidelines on the NHS website for general advice on some aspects of heart disease in general.\n\nLast edited: Feb 3, 2016\n4.

In that case you would need to consider limiting your patients' salt intake (that is, reducing it to less than 1 teaspoon per day); it might be important to consider a reduction to 2 to 3 teaspoons per day, given that these are the approximate amounts that your patients should have consumed in the past (assuming, for the moment, food restrictions were not introduced by you).\nWhat you as your patient know about your disease might be the key to finding a balance between your patient and their treatment. For example, a patient who is very overweight may understand that not all dietary fat is harmful, and a client with diabetes might not have the knowledge to avoid saturated fats or carbohydrates that are high in sugars.\nOther patients might have some concern about what they are eating or the effects of cholesterol or sodium - this you as your patient could have concerns about, but remember that the more common your lipid profile, the lower your patient's triglycerides and cholesterol, and the higher their blood pressure and blood sugar. This is just another way that your patient's health status may affect what should be your focus.\nYou do not need to change your diet completely. You need to plan meals and snacks that are appropriately balanced with the required fat and carbohydrate intake, with plenty of calcium and vitamin D. You should also look at how your lipid profile compares with that of other patients, the national guidelines (see above) as well as your own.\nIt is not just the dietary element; do you still need a consultation?\nThis page is subject to changes over time.

The guidelines that the Heart Association developed were intended to help people choose the right heart health interventions based on their clinical characteristics.\nSo, what do John's CVD risk profiles indicate?\nIt would not make the above statement true or less true than for the same conditions - such as diabetes, smoking, and having a family history of CVD - to which he and other experts agree. What should you do if you are concerned about your heart.\nWhat does that mean for you?\nA cardiologist, a medical doctor who specializes in the treating the heart and blood vessel, should not make a \"rule\" to recommend whether or not you have a high, medium, low, or no current cigarette smoking. But it is important to know where you fit within that continuum.\nFor example, according to some physicians and cardiologists, if you are moderately to severely obese (BMI more than 30), then your coronary heart disease risk could go down if you reduce your tobacco consumption. This does not mean that even the healthy, non-smoking person who is overweight should change what he or she eats. In fact, some heart experts think it's the weight they are concerned about that matters. The obese person, who is overweight, is probably at high risk of not being able to get a high-quality, low-fat diet.\nSo, what does that mean for you?\nWe are told that the recommendations of the Heart Association focus on high, unhealthy LDL cholesterol, medium, medium and low risk cholesterol, high, healthy HDL cholesterol, and the recommendation that it is important for smokers to quit. But that recommendation does not mean your risk will go down, and it may not be so for everybody involved in maintaining, or even improving, a heart regimen.\nWhat are the main factors which affect the development of heart disease?\nFirst, you have risk factors for heart disease.\nSecond, you can become a \"bad,\" \"not a good,\" \"cardiac,\" \"cardiovascular,\" or \"cardiographic,\" person. In a good person, cholesterol, blood sugar, and body weight are controlled through diet and exercise and by your overall lifestyle. But these factors cannot compensate for risk factors for heart disease. When risk factors don't compensate for the factors associated with heart disease, they cause a decrease in heart health.\nThese three factors interact with each other to determine the overall extent of health at every age. In addition, each time the factors interact, we can go from \"bad\" to \"good\" in terms of risk factors. So it is that the heart disease or vascular risk factors - the factors which either increase the risk or mitigate the effects of these cardiovascular risk factors in a healthy person - can be manipulated to increase the chance of developing heart disease or to decrease or maintain the risk of developing heart disease.\nAnother important factor, and one which may be more important than risk factors, is the \"family history.\" A family history of stroke, for instance, might contribute an individual's risk of developing heart disease. The more an individual has smoked before they were diagnosed with the heart disease, the more likely they are to become a good patient to be treated for heart disease.\nPeople who are non-smokers, who are overweight or obese, and who haven't been through any exercise program on a regular basis, or who have less than a high-fat, high-protein, and a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet are all at increased risk for heart disease.\nWhat is the recommended goal for a person who is risk of developing heart disease or is at risk of developing heart disease?\n\"The ideal\" is one goal for all patients, regardless of their risk factors, which is to have a \"great\" or \"good\" cardiovascular health. But some doctors, and probably most people, believe that \"good\" versus \"bad\" is the right way to look at the problem of heart disease. But most heart experts don't give the \"hard\" or \"easy\" approach that the \"hard\" (such as smoking and low cholesterol or high blood pressure) or the \"easy\" approach that the \"high-risk\" factors (such as obesity, overweight, inactive lifestyle and excessive alcohol), make.\nThese approaches to thinking about cardiovascular risk are not correct as we all know from experience, but they are not so long as they come from a very small group of people who have an extraordinary number of answers about their", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\n\n(1) My heart is dead as of September 2019.\n(2) My blood pressure is high as of February 28, 2018.\n\nI need a \"good\" answer, not just a \"very good\" one.

When people were asked what they considered a heart rate < 114/85, it simply turned out to be 7 year old John! This is why I gave you more confidence to use this number. I was referring to the 22. 58%. It only applies to heart rate where blood pressure is above 134/85 mmHg.

He will continue to have his cholesterol and A1C checked.\nNote: This is my personal opinion, this is not a recommended and not a WHO recommendation, this is based from John's personal experiences alone.", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD? The above figures from NICE should have been the most useful resource for us to use to make recommendations and assess risk factors in John's case.\nSo far at the present time, when patients make their own choices about treatment and lifestyle, the results are not going to be as significant. There could be significant complications - from hypertension for example - that could take advantage of a person's decision to give up smoking, exercise more, control their blood cholesterol or take medicines.\nIf John is given medication in the NHS, which is something that can usually be avoided if he gets off the drugs earlier, then the risk of the person suffering side effects is much less because they have been in agreement about his situation. Of course, there is nothing more important to make than a patient's safety - which is the main reason why there were no serious complications from the drug, despite the significant and growing literature on this aspect of treating patients' health.\nBut then John's situation may be too serious for any of the existing options or even drugs to fit. And the chance of an adverse events could be much higher, and that, too, could also be a significant contributing factor in the decisions John makes. There are certainly other medical issues that could put John's life at considerable risk, and these could be identified at the time of a review in NICE by the NHS, to provide further advice. For example - it is now considered that if you have an MI at the time of discharge with a diagnosis of coronary artery calcification on ECHO, there could be great potential for a MI which occurred at a later date, and that there are significant complications in the heart after MI. So not to over complicate things. There are probably many other issues, and the details are now being reviewed by NICE researchers, because of the huge amount of work that needs to be done to identify these issues.\nJohn's overall presentation, for example, should be recognised as abnormal, and there could be a significant risk of the underlying causes of his heart problems such as hypertension or high cholesterol becoming more severe. But when those issues are identified, the risk could be substantially lower. That's something that can be recognised. For example, the risk of cardiovascular events for men with diabetes is less than it is for women. So John may have already had the complications of diabetes, and these would have been present at any age. But the risk is lower for diabetes for all age groups now - it is even much lower for the elderly and middle-aged than it was 3 years ago, at the latest. So it's definitely not unlikely that this could be a useful screening method for patients with coronary artery calcifications. Those same questions need to be addressed in a subsequent NHS review, if they have to be.\nBut at present we are at a stage when many of the key medical issues which have an impact on survival, such as secondary (not fatal) haemorrhage, heart failure, chronic renal failure, cerebrovascular disease, and more, could have much lower mortality rates, and much lower risks to life expectancy for that population of patients. These are all factors which should be taken into account when making those decisions about management of John's condition.\nHow many patients do we need to be included in this range of treatment decisions, to ensure that the risks are lower? And why don't we have enough cases to reach decision support for coronary artery calcification? I think we need to be aware that if we get away from the treatment, there could be serious problems for patients, and of course, patients could be in danger of premature death. The NHS is only the one, however, with the skills to look at this, and we need to think about more people needing to consult.\nNICE guidelines suggest a range of drugs which may be useful for patients, based on the risk assessment of each person. As far as I am aware, there are only a small number of drugs which are known to have an effect on the risk of coronary artery calcification by increasing the number of cholesterol plaques in the arteries. That is, patients who need to take aspirin if they have a history of coronary artery disease may benefit from a statin without a known effect on coronary artery calcification.\nThe 2018 guidelines provide that some 'inadmissibility' medications have been suggested: ACE Inhibitors for coronary artery calcification, and PCSK9 Modulators for high-cholesterol; and the 2018 guidelines offer more specific guidance on 'combination', or combination, drugs for coronary artery calcification. These are medications which have been", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\nSue: Yes. NICE has recommended that you discuss this with your GP.\nThe following can be done if you're pregnant:\n- See your GP. If you think a pregnancy is not related to CVD, your GP will recommend some counselling about the pregnancy and its likely effects on your health.\n- Talk to your family at home. Discuss the pregnancy with your family members and friends; if they agree with you, you may want to have them help with the weight loss and other things you might be afraid to do.\n- You may want to talk to your GP and the medical team about the pregnancy.

Learn how you can begin taking cholesterol lowering medicines. Not all cholesterol lowering medicines have a good effect.

To find information about cholesterol in other countries, go to cholesterol.gov\n10. Learn how to change the diet to one with a much lower LDL, or \"bad,\" cholesterol, to the one that would be healthy. For those looking to quit cigarettes, one must understand that cigarettes are a major factor in getting back to your old LDL numbers.\n11. The one reason you never want to have any higher blood cholesterol levels is because you probably don't actually need to cut down. Your doctor may suggest that you start taking an LDL lowering medicine that will lower your blood cholesterol better than a lower-than-usual one if it has been prescribed.\n12.

Instead, NICE has revised their current guidelines.\n\nWhile NICE's current guidelines on prediabetes may not have an update, you can be fairly certain that prediabetes is a diagnosis that needs a new, updated guideline, even if it's not exactly the same as the current NICE guidelines.\n\nI still wonder if the NICE guideline definition of a prediabetic condition is what John has in mind.\n\n### 1 Answer\n\nFrom my experience, as a practicing pharmacist you would do a lot of basic research, and if your patient doesn't yet have a diagnosis, you'd probably start looking at the medical history of your patient. From that you'll be able to narrow in on some criteria to look at. Then if you are a patient that has a prediabetes diagnosis, you'd look at specific treatment options, and if they're well-tailored to your patient, then it would be easier for your pharmacist to know what to do for them to protect their health.", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\n\nJohn's symptoms suggest a combination of poor eating habits and an underlying condition - he has severe sleep apnea, says one of the primary care doctors for the patient. A review of over 6.6 million Medicare claims showed, among other things, that the patient's \"diabetes medication had side effects which, if allowed to pass the tests, may raise his or her risk for serious heart problems, including heart attack, and other serious consequences of diabetes that could harm blood vessels.\"\n\nJohn is not a diabetic.\n\nThere are numerous cases of diabetes, but the vast majority are not diagnosed with diabetes.\n\nIn fact, the most common diabetic eye disease is called diabetic retinopathy.\n\nIt is the most neglected, least likely patient to benefit. It is a huge, $80M hole in the economic well-being of the people who were supposed to need it. I don't want to go a second to tell you that I'm not a diabetic and my medical advice will not affect anyone. I'm writing a journal about it. Please do not buy into the nonsense of Dr. F. A. Hayek, who has been one of my primary readers for ten years now. I, too, was diagnosed at age 40 with diabetes, and had a better prognosis even than I can now give with technology (I still have some, but I am in so far as I can come, not the last). I also have a couple other, similar complaints. I have a heart problem which seems to get worse with diabetes, and the type 2 diabetes itself is getting worse with it. The primary care doctor suggested a possible, very real risk to my health as a direct result of diabetic medication. I had diabetes for the past ten years. So, at the time, I was quite concerned, but I didn't go for a test. I didn't get the advice. As a result of that, I was in dire financial straits because even if all were cleared I would have had to pay 50% more than I now paid. The best thing I can suggest is to start doing everything right, to go back to high school, to finish school, and get a job. If you go through the middle of the road without getting a job, the worst that can happen is an undone job and a poor pay. I started to see that when I could pay myself back from the drug companies without having to spend the money from selling the drug. I had $450 worth of insurance but, by now, I'm spending $440 on medical and dental expenses and having to spend $4.8K on house maintenance. What's worse the costs now are increasing by almost 500%. Why then, it would seem, would this be an issue. You can't go without insurance or get a mortgage because now 70% of all of the money is going into this problem.\" \"There is nothing to be gained from that. As long as the patients get a prescription to treat, or the patient gets to pay the doctor, no serious conditions can be cured with medicines alone. The only real cure these days is surgery.\" Dr. F. A. Hayek, Ph.D.\n\"There is nothing to be gained from that.\"\n\nIt is only with the aid of technology we can overcome this problem. I recommend to all readers here a search of diabetes, diabetes prevention, and lifestyle change for diabetics, with their links to the IOS, Medicare claims data, a survey on American consumers' perceptions, and a comparison of the actual costs for the different groups.\n\nI have come in contact with another physician, Drs. Naimi and Bailyn, and I find several of the things they have taught you all the time. I have tried his remedies and they have had similar results. He is a wonderful physician, and one of our best for you. I hope he will not only be a true physician, but I believe he will teach you some important lessons from his own life, and maybe inspire you too. Here is the link.\n\n# # # # # # # # # #\n\nThe doctor's quote was from an episode of \"True Science\" where Dr. Bailyn said \"We can't say that it's impossible that people who say that they cannot live well are wrong.

My question is, when your BMI is over 40, does the physician or pharmacist recommend the use of drugs other than cholesterol\u2013lowering drugs to manage your CHD risk? My question also applies to those men who have a family history of CVD - I think my GP cannot help you - but I think you are right that not all people are at risk.\n\n### A man in England who smoked his 20's had a 50% death rate from stroke - as soon as he stopped\n\nHi, I know about the 30 - 60 year old man who smoked a bit in the 1960's. Now I've read about patients in those years, so how long did that last? One of the patients died of stroke 7 years later? We never had anything like this in 20 years.\n\n### Which CHD prevention strategies have the most potential for success?\n\nWe could only predict the outcomes of which strategies have the most potential for success. My team and I will assess how your cardiovascular disease risk profile compares with that of 1043 individuals who are matched with us to help determine which strategy is most appropriate for YOU. There are three main approaches you may take to reduce your cardiovascular disease risk: 1. Exercise for 20 minutes and/or 35 minutes each day. More recent studies have shown exercise alone does almost as much for lowering risk of heart disease as risk factors like smoking. [6, 7, 8] This approach is often called high intensity exercise because it is short and hard (more than 30 minutes a day).\n\n### If it's too difficult to achieve that level of fitness that one wants to take up weight training\n\nIt's probably going to not help if you're a serious weight trainer. For example, someone who may have a 2+2 plan with an 100 pound guy or 40 pound woman or 20 pound man who's trying to reach the 2000 pound target will likely not be inclined to do this either. And so one could end up having to do weight training, but maybe even more to \"tough\" the 100+ pound person is trying to get to 100 pounds.\n\n### Why do I have a heart attack while a smoker?\n\nEven so-called \"heart attack women\" do not have to be exposed to tobacco smoke to experience a heart attack. Smoking increases cholesterol levels and lowers HDL. High cholesterol reduces the flow of blood, causing a build up of plaque (which we'll discuss later), causing a heart attack within minutes of exposure to tobacco smoke. When the plaque is calcified, it forms a blocking substance in the vessels that can't carry blood away from the heart, putting you at a high risk for stroke and death.\n\n### What is important about the 2012-2017 recommendations regarding smoking cessation\n\nThere are new recommendations regarding smoking cessation for people who have been treated for smoking and/or who have recently quit, but for people who need help with starting over.\n\n### What is the best way to manage chronic pain\n\nChronic pain has been shown to be one of the most common health problems for men. For some men, this pain can be disabling, chronic, and difficult to manage. Pain is a part of life for many men. They can experience chronic pain as a result of:\n\n\u2022 Chronic medical conditions, such as heart failure, diabetes, and stroke\n\u2022 Radiation or surgery to the spine\n\u2022 Treatment for cancer, such as chemotherapy\n\u2022 Chronic illnesses, such as arthritis, asthma, migraines, chronic insomnia, and Crohn's disease\n\u2022 Chronic health problems, such as high blood pressure/blood thinners that can lead to clots in the brain\n\u2022 Chronic stress, such as chronic anger, job loss, or financial problems\n\nSome of this pain also goes away and resolves after the time of treatment, but for others it continues.\n\nAs noted above, chronic pain in men has a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease in the setting of smoking.\n\n### What does that mean for me?\n\nI am 60 years old. I have chronic, lifelong pain. I am trying to determine my lifestyle and exercise program while using this data to understand better my treatment and my long-term prospects in living a positive, active life. I have a family history of heart disease and have a family history of CHD if I have my brother (", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD? Of course, the latter recommendations would be suitable for your friend John, just as John should be counseled to prevent diabetes.\nDr. Frey does make it clear that the guidelines don't say that coronary heart disease is a major risk factor for strokes. Instead they suggest prevention of a stroke. While it's true that the prevention of stroke and coronary heart disease are somewhat different, and yet the same prevention is needed to mitigate the heart attack, that distinction is important to understand, because the recommendations for CVD treatment are not specifically about heart attacks, rather they do address high blood pressure and cholesterol, as well as diabetes.\nIf the heart attack and CVD risk factors for your friend John are not the major risk factors, why would you recommend that he have a blood test done and have his cholesterol and blood pressure monitored? This is a very common misconception, even according to the American Heart Association. Cholesterol is measured as levels of good and bad cholesterol, and high levels of bad cholesterol are the major risk factors for CVD and stroke. This is not an indicator of heart attacks. It is not only the number that is high, but also the amount of bad LDL or 'bad' cholesterol. This does not imply that John is a victim of heart attacks, but rather that the risk is higher that means that that man has some sort of health risk, including a heart attack. A good example is a 56-year-old male man who had a heart attack two years ago. After having a second heart attack and still having a heart attack, what is likely causing him to worry about heart attack and the risk of a stroke?\nIn your opinion, does the recommendation for John's cholesterol and blood pressure be valid?\nJohn: Cholesterol is not a major risk factor for heart attacks and strokes, but the diagnosis of high cholesterol and normal values for blood pressure are not a diagnostic test for heart attacks or strokes.\nDr. Frey: High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart attacks and strokes. You can't have high blood calcium levels, or have excessive glucose in the blood, or have a triglyceride in the blood where as you want good HDL levels in your blood because HDL is a good cholesterol, not another category of cholesterol. These are the same things that are normal values for cholesterol and blood pressure. So not having too much. This is a major risk factor and not a risk factor for coronary heart disease, nor is it a risk factor for stroke, heart attack, or CVD.\nPatients who have high blood cholesterol will often develop an intolerance to dietary cholesterol. If they can be on a high-fat diet (such as with eating bacon, egg, and peanut butter ) then they will produce enough of the cholesterol from diet to have a low level, and not enough to have a large level, which can be a problem. For example, if people eat a lot of cream of wheat flour they could be intolerant to it, which could lead to heart disease.\nThey can have dietary cholesterol, but they have to be on a low-fat diet to not have a large level which could lead to heart disease. Also, one of the symptoms is having an intolerance to low-fat dairy products, which will lead to a lot of other problems, including a liver problem, which will make it harder for your liver to work. So, all of the important health concerns related to high levels of cholesterol and blood pressure - heart attack, heart failure, stroke, and the damage caused to the coronary arteries - can be averted by eating a small amount of dairy products from a small amount of cholesterol diet, as well as a small amount of fat and exercise as part of a healthy diet.\nIf you want to see him, why, do you give him a drink of juice as he eats this breakfast?\nJohn: I try to eat high-fat, low-carb dairy products. This is best known to me as a milk alternative. I eat cheese in the morning, because it's lower in fat than other dairy products. If it's not dairy, I get it in the form of soy milk.\nDr. Frey: Soy milk is a good source of protein and has been proven to help keep lean, muscle-bound man's. It contains lots of calcium and a little potassium which would be a good thing for a man with heart attacks or strokes.\nBecause of the low-fat dairy products, the number of people who have heart attacks or strokes is decreasing. This has very good effects because there hasn't been a great deal of research showing heart disease, cardiovascular disease, or stroke is", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\nIt's likely that the following CVD guidelines might be appropriate in John's case. The first is the \"healthy-old-man\" approach. The second is the \"active-lifestyle\" approach, which includes a much greater degree of flexibility regarding the way in which you can prevent and manage CVD.\nThere are, however, other CVD guidelines that could also be useful. Consider the recommendations for the American Heart Association on smoking cessation. For instance, smoking cessation is shown to benefit heart health by 23-26 percent, and may even be beneficial for coronary heart disease.\nSmoking cessation strategies are also appropriate for other conditions that are potentially high-risk for CVD. For example, the American Council on Exercise's (ACE) A-E Fitness for Adults 2020 - 2024 guidelines suggests that it is not appropriate for people to be taking prescription medicines to reduce cholesterol, even when they already have cholesterol levels above the target range. Instead, it would be better to take medication for cholesterol and cardiovascular disease, specifically for LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol.\nFor more information on \"ACE\"'s A-E Fitness for Adults 2020 - 2024 guidelines, along with specific recommendations that match the following guidelines, download the full document here.\nMore resources, including:\n- A-E Fitness for Adults 2020 - 2024: a step-by-step guide to the ACE A-E Fitness program and its associated assessments\n- Learn everything about A-E Fitness: its A-E Fitness Guidelines and Program Structure, along with some sample exercises from the video and website\n- ACE A-E Fitness and its A-E Fitness Guide for Children with Specific Concerns (PDF) and how to implement it at home\n- ACE A-E Fitness and its A-E Fitness Guide for Adults with Specific Concerns (PDF) for those with a family history (for people not yet on a prescribed medication)\n- ACE A-E Fitness for Adults with a family history of cardiovascular disease: A 30-question screener and program design study\nDr. Kusakabe has taught for 33 years.\nIn addition to being certified by A-E Fitness for Adults 2020 - 2024, the physician can expect to work closely with each patient to devise a comprehensive and varied cardiac and physical exercise program for their individual needs.\nFor more information about cardiovascular-related training and exercises, please feel free to email our Fitness Program Program Development team at 760-390-4382 or firstname.lastname@example.org.\nThe A-E Fitness for Adults 2020 - 2024 Guidelines are available at: A-E Fitness for Adults 2020 - 2024: A Step-by-Step Guide to ACE A-E Fitness.

If screening has not been recommended, one should consider that an individual with an abnormal blood cholesterol profile in relation to other individuals with a similar profile will benefit from intervention.\n- This initial screening should be based on current lifestyle behaviours, ideally on a patient's own advice.\n- This initial screening should be conducted at least at least annually\n- If a person is already diagnosed with CVD, a regular follow-up is recommended - for example, to see if these lifestyle changes are being maintained, and if required other tests should be done, such as chest CT scan.\nWhat should a person with a risk of heart disease to take note of?\n- A recent report by the British Medical Journal has concluded that those aged 45 to 55 years with an average risk of 50/90/95/96, should take 45/60/ 88/25, which, although it means taking twice or three times the recommended dose for people with higher risk, is an almost 14% reduction in their risk compared to taking the usual dose of 25.\n- This new advice may also be relevant in the UK in the UK's new NHS 'Aging' strategy.\nThe UK's Ageing Strategy describes recommendations on how older adults should be supported to live longer, and includes advice on how to make lifestyle changes, which may include diet, exercise, smoking and blood pressure control for those on medication, and a range of other lifestyle and medication advice.\nAlthough the older people should be taking lifestyle, lifestyle modification interventions could include a regular visit to the GP who will also measure blood pressure levels, and discuss how to keep their blood pressure under control with diet and a range of other lifestyle and medication advice.\nWhat else can you tell me of the NICE guidelines?\n- Why have the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published guidelines (they are published every three years, and update them regularly) for the prevention of heart disease in different kinds of people?\n- What recommendations are provided by NICE on the monitoring of blood pressure in UK adults?\n- Do we need another NHS strategy?\n- Explain the three types of NHS recommendations (eg screening, lifestyle modification, lifestyle modification intervention, pharmacological intervention and medication recommendations) to be used in the National Health Service (NHS).

This includes getting to 10,000 steps per day, eating a healthy diet, staying active, controlling stress, and taking medicines as advised by your doctor\nIf these are not considered part of your cardiovascular risk factors, we would suggest going to your local council and getting the advice that will help you achieve this goal. For most people, having a BMI of 25-35 is a bit high and you can make a change but it requires time to get there. It will take a lifetime, that is how long we think our life expectancy is.\nHow much is needed to be healthy? This is a very important question to ask yourself because it will affect the number of steps that you take a day. Think that you go from 6 \u2013 10 steps a day to 10 steps a day and in total, you will have a 15 \u2013 20 step difference in one day. This is a healthy goal because we all take a step a day, but you don\u2019t think about it and that is not healthy for your body. One step will be enough in relation to all your other steps for 7 days. That is not ideal because this is a challenge to overcome.\nCan this goal be increased? If you have a target of 15, 20, 25-30, it isn\u2019t really a very large challenge. One question I\u2019m asked quite often is, is this goal going to be reached? Some people will find that this number is different and they will need to use a slightly different approach. One, for example, can make a big step as often as it costs. We can do everything we need to do and still see to it that those 2 steps remain in line with the guideline. Or maybe we could spend a month or a 6-month stretch to improve the number of steps a day and that is going to be enough. However, I believe that this is a very challenging goal and we should give people our backside of this goal.\nThere is an added challenge to the lifestyle changes as well, for example, some adults take medications for another condition that causes them to be out of the routine of getting their steps down a significant amount. These people should receive a referral to a cardiologist to get their medication checked out in order to find out if there is any need for some lifestyle changes.\nWhat are the other things that individuals can help ourselves in their goals of becoming healthier?\nOne thing that I think is very important in some people is to build awareness around having positive lifestyle changes. We can look at our own actions and how many steps we are taking a day to get to 10,000 steps per day. If you are sitting too far back, try being up to 500 steps a day, if you are driving a long distance and you are sitting a lot more than 10,000 steps a day, there is a lot of good that you can do. I know that there is a lot of interest to be seen in getting a 10,000 step goal, in addition to 30 minutes of walking a day. You can use your phone and get advice about what your options are, what can you do with that. You don\u2019t have to stop you, there is so much that is available to assist you.\nHave any of our colleagues at the NHS are recommending changes in their own lives that are relevant to their health?\nI am interested in changing my lifestyle because my cardiovascular risk factor is quite high. My husband works long hours, I have work, my days are very long and he doesn\u2019t get off often so I want to have something to do. My primary care physician said they would be helpful for me to do it and there are a lot of people in my area who have this concern.\nWhat recommendations can I give my patients as a preventative healthcare professional?\nA great reminder that the overall picture is very different for the two people in the chart, I\u2019d recommend everyone make a list of what you see as your current level of cardiovascular risk, even more so if someone has a history of cardiovascular disease and even more so when you hear about how long you have been living a sedentary lifestyle.\nThe average person would be getting a cardio", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\nAnswer: The guidelines from NICE recommend that people diagnosed with diabetes should also have a low-dose aspirin every 12 months, if necessary. This could involve the administration of aspirin by direct injection, or a continuous low-dose aspirin medication. Low-dose aspirin should be considered for people with an elevated risk of heart attack or stroke. This recommendation is supported by the NICE guideline: Prevention of heart conditions (2014) \u2018Limits of aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular complications\u2019 which recommends that only if there is an elevated risk of CVD is it recommended to have low-dose aspirin, but then it may be adjusted to be appropriate for people already taking aspirin as a preventive measure.\nHow do my medications (insulins and hypoglycemic oral agents) affect my heart?\nAnswer: This is important because some medicines which are classified as \u2018antihypertensive\u2019 (see chapter 6) can affect my arteries. Diabetes is one of the most common (but rarely necessary) causes of severe hypertension (high blood pressure). It has been shown in very few studies to increase the risk of heart attack or stroke.1\nWhy does my LDL cholesterol level increase?\nAnswer: There are several mechanisms which regulate LDL cholesterol concentrations, one of which is the presence of low-density lipoprotein (LDL-D), which can have a negative effect on atherosclerotic plaque. Lower-density lipoprotein (LDL-R) concentration is generally decreased and is considered to be associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Higher levels of LDL-R are thought to represent increased blood levels of free fatty acids which could have an adverse effect on myocardial blood flow.\nWhat does blood lipid values tell me, and how are people affected by poor lipid control?\nAnswer: One of the difficulties with assessing lipid status is the inability to assess many of the metabolic parameters such as blood glucose, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol which are useful in identifying people at risk of coronary heart disease and developing other cardiovascular management strategies. In addition, a higher total cholesterol level is commonly found in people with diabetes without coronary heart disease (CHD); therefore it may be beneficial to screen for blood lipid levels in patients before treatment. For adults with CVD this is especially important.\nHow often do people visit a doctor for a lipid profile? What will my blood lipid levels tell me?\nAnswer: My lipid levels are usually obtained from a single blood sample taken at fasting. Usually, my 3-day lipid fasting is only done if I already have the results obtained from my blood lipid test. Because of the importance of lipid levels in predicting the outcomes of a patient\u2019s cardiovascular health, other methods have been developed to measure these parameters more frequently for certain groups of patients.\nWhat are my treatment options for my CVD?\nAnswer: Treatment options for CHD include lifestyle modifications including weight management, exercise, and a diet that is appropriate for my weight. Other drugs have also been shown to affect my lipid profiles which, as we have already mentioned, could have an impact on my atherosclerotic plaque and its development. Drug therapies which, however, may have side effects for people who are not diabetic or in whom my LDL-R is high, are not particularly useful for preventing heart attacks or strokes.\nIf I have a diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes, would it be advisable for me to take medications such as metformin (also known by its brand name, Glucophage) to prevent my blood sugar (GLU-12) from spiking above normal levels? How long does this treatment need to be for?\nAnswer: No, metformin is not recommended for Type 1 Diabetes because, as we have already mentioned, there are many patients who are on prediabetes medications without developing diabetes and who are at lower risk of developing Type 1 DM if I take metformin. However, because metformin is taken daily, the dosage regimen can be modified to suit my situation. When I take metformin for Type 1 Diabetes, the effects of the drug are transient, so I would only need to take the dosage on an empty stomach in the early morning or early in the evening. Also, it should be mentioned that a low-dose insulin is prescribed to help maintain euglycemia, but, as mentioned in this chapter, I think I would need to avoid both metformin and insulin for my Type 1 Diabetes. If I have a diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes, I would probably be recommended to begin with one of the other regimens and to have the results obtained through a blood lipid", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\nThis is not the first post in which you would write such a simple document that everyone around you can understand \u2013 it\u2019s just what it should be: the first step in your quest for longevity.", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\nDr Manjul Thiek, Consultant Cardiologist at London St Thomas\u2019 Hospital - NHS Lothian, said: \u201cThe NICE guidelines and the NICE advice on \u2018what to call people with heart disease\u2019 are all geared to people who are clinically asymptomatic, those with a mild heart disease and those who have an established course of heart disease.\u201d\nThis guideline states:\n- Those with no clinical features are advised to get involved in \u2018cardioprotective lifestyle\u2019 practices.\n- They must be kept engaged in the \u2018Cardioprotective Lifestyle Practice to Prevent CVD (CPLCP)\u2019 \u2013 that is, make sure they get a weekly dose of advice (46 mg of vitamin B6, 1g of vitamin B12, 7 g of zinc, 4 g of copper, 20 g of phosphorus, 10 g of calcium, 5 g of magnesium and 1 g of iron) weekly plus at least 30 minutes of physical activity after meals or when they have lunch each day in the form of moderate physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise, for a total of 3000 steps.\n- Those whose heart disease is severe enough (or who have a diagnosis of coronary heart disease) are advised to get some advice in case the heart condition is on a life threatening course.\n\u201cIt is important to remember that the majority of people who suffer from a heart attack come from low-income and/or deprived areas. Even people who are well receive little or no advice or treatment.\u201d\nDr Thiek said: \u201cHowever, we have very strong support and evidence for lifestyle programmes such as the CPLCP. They can be particularly beneficial in improving people\u2019s heart health and reducing the risk of developing CVD.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cWhile the risk of cardiovascular disease is highest when a person is already ill, we know that a good lifestyle will help to ward off a heart attack with or without symptoms.\n\u201cThe advice gives us an opportunity to provide advice based on the latest evidence to those who have already had heart disease. The aim of the programme is to enable people to take an active approach to what a healthy lifestyle may possibly contain.\n\u201cAt NICE UK we have a \u2018cardioprotective lifestyle\u2019 guideline which is particularly relevant to patients who are newly diagnosed with a heart disease.\n\u201cThis is a very important guide, because many patients have already been told about the need to be actively involved in their own heart-healthy lifestyle.\n\u201cThe NHS guidelines are useful but what matters is that people ask themselves what lifestyle change would be most helpful.\n\u201cOn average only about 48% of people who are treated for heart disease are aware (or actively involved) of their risks and the need for a certain lifestyle change.\u201d\nDr Thiek said: \u201cWe also strongly recommend that they be encouraged to learn how they can access NHS support if they were to seek help for their heart disease.\n\u201cIt is important that people start or complete the NHS NHS Heart Health Service in line with the recommendations that we are promoting at NHS UK.\n\u201cThe NHS Heart Health Service is a very important opportunity for young people and those who care for them to take their heart health seriously and learn about what they can do to help make it better.\n\u201cWe are currently funding the \u2018NHS Heart Health Service\u2019 at over \u00a310m.\u201d\nDr Thiek said the guidelines provided for the NHS Heart Health Service were tailored to enable people to identify lifestyle changes that could be taken to prevent heart disease, which would result in saving time and from a greater patient satisfaction.\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that the majority of people who suffer from a heart disease are already ill, therefore what we need is more attention. We should target to these people if we are going to provide the best care they can \u2013 so they could be able to take control of the way they live their life and achieve their best potential.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always important to be supported to change their heart disease, but it\u2019s also essential that patients want to be involved in the decision making in terms of their heart conditions.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWe want to help people think about their lifestyle change, and then make it a reality.\n\u201cWe have a lot of patients who are already getting good health advice and motivation from their colleagues, or even from family members, because they are using the resources of the NHS within their own NHS care.\u201d", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\n[Read more\u2026] about What Are the Basics of A Healthy Diet for People With Diabetes?", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\nAnswer: The recommendations in NICE include a five-year goal for total cholesterol levels of <100 mmol/mol. A 35% increase in blood pressure within the first month of a new lifestyle modification suggests a target of >150/100 mmHg.\nThe guidelines also recommend a 3000-calorie diet plus 250 minutes of exercise daily for women and 2500-calorie diet per week for men. Women aged 65 years and above are less likely to have CVD, and men and older women are less likely to have CHD.\nThe authors emphasise that it is important to understand that CVD incidence and death are largely driven by risk factors such as excess weight and hypertension, and that lifestyle advice is not just limited to reducing weight.\nWhile the recommendations for CVD may seem like an overwhelming set of measures, the evidence indicates that they represent a real opportunity to help prevent CVD.

High triglycerides and cholesterol from the Chinese eating and smoking may be factors, but we should also take into account the genetic factors\u201d. The risk of death from heart disease can be reduced when we take the risk factors in the context of dietary intake, a healthy lifestyle and reduce risk factors of CVD.\nDietary intake and its impact on CVD risk\nThe association of dietary intake with CVD (anorexia, obesity and Type II diabetes) was first documented by Berenson et al. In a recent BMJ Open study, people who ate the most animal protein (from red or processed meat) had an increase in the risk of not being at a heart attack even if they managed to exercise (at least 120 minutes per week, moderate physical activity) more than 30% of the participants showed significant improvement in heart attack, mortality and death-related factors, and higher levels of adiponectin in the body. The results of this new study suggest that the Mediterranean Dietary Pattern (MDP) may reduce death rates among adults who have high food intake (high protein, low sugar) while having a heart disease risk (hypertension, heart failure). For this reason, the MDP would be considered for treatment by a general practitioner.\nSmoking: the relationship with CVD?\nOne of the most important CVD prevention recommendations is the reduction of smoking during pregnancy. Smoking is one of the main risk factors of both heart and respiratory diseases, both in women and men. The risk of heart disease in the first decades after childbirth is lower when quitting smoking to increase the risk significantly. Tobacco is a major factor in CVD in non-smokers and, as we know, quitting tobacco is more difficult for smokers than for non-smokers. Smokers can prevent the majority of the risk of cardiovascular disease by quitting smoking. However, if there is a nicotine response, for example when quitting, it is less noticeable if the nicotine is already present in cigarettes than in the non-cigarette products. For this reason, it is important to find out the dose of nicotine necessary for successful cessation while avoiding any negative effects on smoking cessation, taking care not to exceed the nicotine tolerance, which is expressed by a range of acceptable thresholds and the number of hours that the smoker must stay in contact with the environment. The most common symptoms to treat a smoking problem are headaches, fatigue, loss of libido and poor concentration. The dose may be adjusted in the light of the number of hours smoked, smoking rates and the number of days smoked. For any of these symptoms it is highly recommended that cessation is started at the very earliest stage.\nNutritional deficiencies: What should we do?\nVitamin and mineral deficiencies in adults are a common problem, and can cause poor health and increase the risk of developing diseases such as heart disease. In particular, vitamin D is responsible for the protection of bones and blood vessels, and the levels of vitamin D are directly related to the risks of heart and vascular disease and the risks of type II diabetes. In fact, vitamin D is very important for the prevention of diabetes. People with diabetes are at risk of a higher proportion of developing cardiovascular disease; in addition, vitamin D increases the risk of developing the disease by 70%. It is well known that vitamin D is essential as a cofactor in the synthesis of cholesterol and LDL receptors and, as a cofactor in the synthesis of fibrinogen and vascular smooth muscle. This relationship between vitamin D and its bioavailability is different between different types of dietary intake.\nAs the levels of vitamin D in the body are directly related to the presence or absence of vitamin D metabolites that are absorbed directly and are transported to various tissues, the vitamin D status in the body does not require a specific dietary intake. On the other hand, low vitamin D status may indicate conditions of less favorable vitamin D metabolism. Thus, a positive vitamin D status indicates a diet rich in plant sources of vitamin D and an intake of fortified foods, especially oily fish such as salmon and tuna, in combination with vitamin D fortification.\n- Inadequate intake\nIt is recommended to consume foods and drink sufficient amounts of natural and plant forms of vitamin D for the prevention of coronary heart disease (see below)\n- Lack of sun exposure, or insufficient sun exposure or use of sunscreen\n- Unhealthy lifestyle, such as unhealthy eating habits, and lack of physical activity\n- Sedentary lifestyle, including a sedentary job, working long hours, not getting enough sleep and having a heavy diet\n- Insufficient or missing other dietary", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\nYour answer: The NICE guidelines that I am referring to for \u201cprevention,\u201d they are guidelines for \u201cthe reduction of the risk of CVD [Cardiology Centre, 4th-September, 2015]\u201d, which is what your doctor is trying to make his/her patients aware of. By \u201cthe reduction of the risk of CVD,\u201d they allude to the reduction of cardiovascular risk factors, most importantly, the ones that are high blood pressure, high blood lipids, smoking, and high levels of cholesterol, as well as the need to lower your \u201cLDL [bad LDL] and raise your \u2018HDL [good]\u201d if you are at risk. By \u201cthe reduction of the risk of CVD [Cardiovascular disease,\u201d it is saying in this definition that you are in a \u201cmoderate to high risk of CVD,\u201d and how to start living that \u201ckind of lifestyle,\u201d is \u201clow cholesterol and smoking.\u201d\nThis is the essence of NICE recommendations for risk factors of the cardiovascular diseases, that your doctor, as the primary prevention doctor, and you and others get to know, should be aware, or at the very least be informed, the factors that are high on the blood-cholesterol and blood-blood-lipid and low on the \u2018bad\u2019 cholesterol or the \u2018bad\u2019 high-density lipoprotein and the high blood-LDL that you should decrease. Therefore, what\u2019s the point?

They are \u201cCVD\u201d or, \u201cCardiovascular disease.\u201d We are talking about the coronary heart disease. The major cause of coronary heart disease is \u201chigh cholesterol [caused by a poor diet (overfat and obesity) and lack of exercise, stress, hypertension (high blood pressure); smoking; inadequate dietary intake of fats and cholesterol; alcohol intake (saturated fatty acids); tobacco smoking (nicotine); lack of exercise, obesity and excess body fat (thyroid diseases; obesity; low-fat diet; lack of physical activity) ; high cholesterol in men and very high cholesterol in women,\u201d you don\u2019t want to have in your diet and you don\u2019t want to know what causes you to be obese.

It is becoming more common every year, especially in the 70-79 age range. Many people don\u2019t realise that if they get too much salt in their diet, such as from salted food, this can increase their blood pressure. You may also hear the term \u2018hypertensive\u2019 used when talking about you or a friend. It\u2019s always a good idea to check what the NHS\u2019s new recommendations are before coming to a health consultation.\nNICE has written the next version of their guidelines to guide the way the NHS wants to deal with heart diseases and how to offer people advice on what they need to do if they have a medical condition, like hypertension.\nYou can read the updated advice in the blog \u201cMore steps to go for your heart\u201d, which is now available on the NHS website.

As you get older you may find things to worry about that you may have not recognised when you were young. This could be something physical like the way you look or feel, or something psychological such as your attitude or how you see the world. By being aware of these issues, you can find out when you are worried and talk it to a doctor.\nIt\u2019s more important now to be aware of your symptoms so that you are able to find out if something is wrong and ask for early medical advice.\nSome people, whether they be men or women, get a little bit more anxiety and concerns about their lifestyle because they think there are more things out there that cause heart disease than they have to. Sometimes changes, like less pressure on the heart, stress on the body and more physical activity will cause changes in your lifestyle, and therefore in your heart health if you do end up having a heart attack.\nAt times you may need more treatment to make you feel better because you might be more in pain, have less energy, or have more other complaints than others. If you have any of these symptoms, you should talk to your doctor or GP about them.\nTalk to your doctors if you think you have symptoms that may be a concern, but you\u2019re unsure whether there can be a problem.\nHow should people get the right information?\nEveryone should get all the information they need about their own heart health. We\u2019ll try to provide you with detailed, easy to understand information on heart health, but if it\u2019s not for them you may not be able to afford to. That\u2019s why we have put so much more information together with advice and information you can ask from our Health &", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\n1. Diet changes\nObesity has an impact on many of the other chronic diseases. According to the latest NICE guidelines, 15% of those with a BMI of \u2265 40 and 10% of those with a BMI of \u2265 30 are likely to have one of the key CVD risk factors and need more specific CVD prevention recommendations.\nSo, what diet advice would be the same as for people with a BMI \u2265 30 for CVD prevention, except for more targeted advice on calorie needs? The advice would be an individualised approach for the specific weight category, with recommendations on total and LDL cholesterol levels. That way, people would live healthier for longer and be more empowered to manage their weight and their CVD risk.\n2. Exercise and physical activity\nThere has been a huge increase in the prevalence of obesity in recent years, with recent global rates of 29% of the population classed as obese in 20191. Weight-related obesity is estimated to be about 15% of premature mortality1, however, according to the same NICE guidelines, it is very important to reduce your weight by even 10% or 25% if you are obese2.\nObesity brings an increased likelihood of developing many of the common chronic conditions we are all familiar with. This includes some of the more common cardiovascular diseases3,12 such as:\n- Heart disease\n- Type 2 diabetes\n- Kidney disease\n- Osteoarthritis and osteoporosis\n- Sleep disorders\n- Heart attacks\n- Heart failure\nHow much activity does everyone need? According to NICE, the recommended amount of activity is between 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity (e.g. cycling, swimming) plus 75 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity (e.g. jogging, hiking) or body weight resistance (e.g. weight lifting) a week.\n3. Diet changes\nReducing your total weight without changing the amount of caloric intake (energy) is not easy. We know that many people with obesity are unaware of their obesity status, so even if they have lost significant amounts of weight, are unlikely to be able to change their total energy intake without cutting back on certain foods.\nIn general, the healthier the food chain, the greater the likelihood you will gain any weight back after you cut back on your calories. While there is currently no single way to lose weight, research and evidence suggests that the ideal outcome in terms of weight loss is a healthy transition from obesity to normal body weight (weight loss of 5% to less than 15 kg after 1-5 years). A more healthy weight can be maintained to prevent death and other chronic diseases after 5 years of continuous loss of weight.\nWhich diet changes should people need to make?\nWhat to watch for while making diet changes:\n- Weight gain after dietary changes, particularly in the absence of sufficient exercise\n- Not achieving the recommended daily calories (1500-2000 calories per day)\n- Not losing weight after dieting\n- Not reaching the recommended daily calorie limit of 1,600-2,000 calories per day\nWhat to watch for while making exercise guidelines:\nWhile most people will benefit from the same exercise guideline (10-15 min a day, 4 times a week), there is still a lot of variation. In fact, a number of different recommendations have been put forward because of the variety of types and different goals, or different exercise modes. The main health benefits of exercising consistently are reduced risk of disease, improved physical fitness and increased quality of life.\nSo, which types of exercise need a different approach? A range of exercise has been found to be beneficial and safe for people with mild, moderate and severe cardiovascular disease, but not for people with severe obesity.\nFor example, in the UK, researchers found that 20 minutes of moderate exercise four to six days per week was associated with reduced cardiometabolic risks in both men and women.\nHowever, 80-90% of people do not meet the exercise guidelines\nAt the heart of this research was a strong correlation between exercise and improved quality of life, so it is safe to assume that the same exercise guidance applies to more people with moderate-to-severe cardiovascular disease when trying to achieve a better quality of life, regardless of weight.\nFor further information on the advice from NICE guidelines, see our recent report on \u2018the evidence base on exercise and cardiovascular disease.\n", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\nSara, I would propose a simple concept: a healthy lifestyle is different from a healthy lifestyle.\nFor example, I would suggest a diet rich in whole grains, fruits and vegetables, a moderate amount of low-fat protein, moderate amounts of low-carbohydrate protein, and a moderate amount of healthy fats. I also would recommend a moderate amount of alcohol and not smoking.\nThese are all healthy lifestyle recommendations that are similar to the recommendations you would find in the World Health Organization\u2019s 2017 Global Physical Activity Guidelines.\nWe currently know that CVD is twice as common in men as in women, yet the WHO recommends that CVD risk should be reduced from the current 20-50% to 15-20%, reducing the cardiovascular burden by 30 years.\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that just because a man is an older, more urban, more sicker person doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s going to get more CVD.\nA number of things contribute to a higher CVD risk. For example, there are numerous risk factors for CVD, such as high blood pressure, smoking, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and stress. People who smoke or abuse alcohol are also at high risk for CVD. On the other hand, if someone is living a \u2018healthy lifestyle\u2019, that means eating a healthy diet, going to the gym regularly, and doing things they enjoy like gardening, etc., they\u2019re at low risk for CVD.\nI\u2019d like to see more clear guidelines about CVD prevention. That would provide a roadmap for doctors to prescribe high-risk patients or groups with high CVD risk to lifestyle modifications. Then, the whole process of creating a comprehensive CVD prevention recommendation for health, would become much easier.\nIn my recent talk, I shared how to create a CVD prevention guideline, a step-by-step guide for the implementation. I talked to cardiologists and public health experts about how to create a comprehensive CVD preventive recommendation, and I presented specific strategies to use in community settings such as primary care clinics, schools, religious communities, work settings.\nThese may well be basic principles to help health professionals in the community apply CVD prevention recommendations.\nWe hope they will help raise awareness of CVD in the community.\nI\u2019d like to thank my audience for their curiosity and support of my talk.\nI\u2019m very pleased about reaching two million viewers through COVID-19. It might be the most impressive thing we\u2019re having over the past month in my career, but I\u2019m grateful to be there. This is really important, because I\u2019m so glad that it can happen during a difficult time due to the pandemic. There is so much hope because many of the countries around the world, including Australia, have seen a big drop in COVID-19 cases. And I\u2019m looking forward to seeing them all resume their normal lives again.\nCardiovascular disease has reached epidemic proportions in Australia, and the majority of us are experiencing cardiac problems that are potentially silent or asymptomatic.\nUnfortunately, as everyone knows, getting a heart attack can be a killer, so it\u2019s time to take action.\nHere are some key points to keep in mind when trying to raise awareness of heart disease:\nYou can help prevent heart disease. You can support your local fire department with free CPR training\nYou can spread awareness about heart damage by sharing your heart-saving tips you\u2019ve learned at your workplace. Your work may not be in heart disease, but it\u2019s still helpful for preventing serious medical conditions.\nKeep active. Get to 150 minutes a week of aerobic exercise, moderate exercise, or 75 minutes. There\u2019s been an uptick in people participating in regular workouts as governments allow people to start exercising at home.\nUse a tool from the World Health Organization (WHO) to improve your cardiac health in Australia. You can help the people in your care through a toolkit called \u201cCardiovascular Health in Australia\u201d with a wealth of other resources.\nTake care of your skin. Keep a clean and healthy skin by staying hydrated, eating foods high in vitamin C, getting plenty of sunshine, and avoiding irritants such as cigarette smoke, perfume, and the chemicals used in home washing.\nIn summary, heart disease is a preventable disease. Although it\u2019s still difficult to prevent, you can take positive steps today to lower your risk of cardiovascular events and increase your level of cardiovascular health. You never know when heart disease will strike, but with proper medical and lifestyle measures, you can mitigate the risk and get", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be? [A]\n- A: The recommended diet for patients at risk of cardiovascular disease includes an elimination of saturated fat and cholesterol.\n- B: These recommendations are based on the NICE guidelines on cardiorenal disease.\n- A: The recommended diet for patients at risk of CVD is the Mediterranean dietary pattern.\n- A: The Mediterranean diet is rich in vegetables, fruits, fish,nuts, olive oil, olive extract, legumes, cereals, and cereals.\n- B: The recommended diet for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases is the Mediterranean diet.\n- B: The dietary patterns of the Mediterranean area are similar to what people in the UK do. (36)\n- In the third line of this question, how would you respond to the following statement?\nQ: Some people in the UK follow a diet which emphasizes oily fish instead of vegetable oils, but there are studies which suggest that these oils may increase blood cholesterol. In what situations should doctors be advised to change the diet?\nA: If someone already has a diet which reduces blood cholesterol, because it is high in saturated fats or cholesterol from meat, eggs, dairy products, and eggs, and it is also very low in polyunsaturated fats and/or trans fats, they should ask for advice about dietary changes in this situation.\n- A: There is evidence that if only high-density lipoproteins are decreased, but not saturated fatty acids, the risk of heart disease is reduced.\nThe patient who is concerned about high blood cholesterol levels and the recommendations for diet and lifestyle are at high risk of CVD. The lifestyle advice for this person is to reduce the intake of saturated fats (but not all fats) in the diet. But a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is good, that is, it gets stuck in the liver to be removed from the blood and so also helps remove cholesterol from the arteries. The patient is advised to increase his intake of polyunsaturated fats to as high a level as possible. The patient is also advised to check whether he is having liver cirrhosis, which increases the risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver. For people on low cholesterol, HDL is only recommended to be 100 mg/dL, for people on high cholesterol, HDL is not recommended if either HDL level is greater than 35 mg/dL. There are several other nutrients which are recommended, which we will discuss next.\nA. Saturated and Trans Fats\nB. Cholesterol in the Diet\nSaturated: These fats (mainly solid fats) come from foods. These have the natural double bonds which make them so sweet. Common types of saturated fats include these ones:\n- CHO and SFA\u2019s\nThey\u2019re good for your heart but may cause damage to your blood vessels if you have them.\nDietary Fats: This kind of fat gets stuck inside the cells of your body and as a result, it raises your bad cholesterol levels and lowers your good cholesterol levels.\n- Fats in the diet, e.g. saturated fats\n- These foods are found in meats, dairy products, eggs, peanut butter, etc.\nTypes of saturated fat in the diet:\n- Saturated fatty acids (SFA)\n- Fatty acids are made by plants. These are called Arachidonic Acid (AA) acids.\n- AA acids are converted into C12 hexanedione by a process called fatty acylation.\n- A10, AA, AA, AA, a1, and a10 have high saturated fatty acid content.\n- Saturated fatty acids generally have the following properties:13-20\n- 14-22\n- 15-16\n- 16-25\n- 17-20", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\nAn important feature of this study, and the focus of further investigations, is the assessment of the risk factors associated with CVD. It used a cohort model, i.e., the probability of having CVD for a given health outcome was calculated based on information from the participants, including age, sex, BMI, and other relevant information. This allows researchers to identify risk groups based on information that might have not been recognized previously.\nThis study focused on data from the National Health and Morbidity Survey in China between the years 1999 and 2005, of which 557,581 were included in this analysis, as well as data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003, of which 594,605 were included in the analysis on the basis of age, sex, and health outcomes. The total CVD burden was calculated by using the national average for age, sex, and BMI and the prevalence of CVD was calculated based on the same national data as the earlier cohort study, for which it was analyzed as both a cohort study and a population based study.\nUsing the incidence data for stroke, dementia, and chronic heart failure, the risk of CVD, in particular, cardiovascular mortality (including the development of cardiac problems), was calculated, and CVD was calculated as the risk of CVD with an index of 20 percent lower risk.\nThe total prevalence of CVD in this study was 15.1 percent, which was higher than the data published by the Centers for Disease Control in the United States reported in 2011. For a more comprehensive database with better epidemiological data on the Chinese population, CVD prevalence in this Chinese study was determined with a new approach. It was also possible to identify patients in the same age group as the previous cohort study from a much larger cohort of 3 million subjects that met all the study inclusion criteria and data from a previous cohort study. In addition, it was possible to determine whether there were differences between different CVD populations, and whether differences in lifestyle, lifestyle patterns, and smoking habits had an impact on CVD. In addition to the Chinese data, data was also included from the Canadian and United States health surveys with the data collection being conducted in 2015 among the Chinese population.\nThe study also found that CVD incidence was similar or higher among older Chinese people than among other age groups. This finding may indicate that people in this age group, including those with an average risk, are at increased risk in terms of age-specific CVD mortality.\nIt was discovered that the prevalence of CVD in Chinese people was higher than in other Asian populations, including people in the West Asian population. This was likely caused by the fact that the Chinese population population of the West Asian and Indian populations were much smaller than the Chinese populations in other countries, and because China is the largest economic and population leader in the world. The Chinese people had a much higher overall risk of CVD, including heart disease, in comparison with other Asian populations.\nFurthermore, individuals with higher cardiovascular parameters in this study were more likely to develop CVD in the following years: stroke, cognitive defects, high blood pressure, and elevated cholesterol. A combination of these factors contributed together to an increased risk of CVD.\nTo provide a baseline for future studies examining the Chinese population\u2019s overall health, they included a 10-year cohort study where the subjects are asked about potential CV causes. The 10-year cohort showed that the cardiovascular parameters of the Chinese population in this study were significantly higher than the Chinese population in other Asian populations. Furthermore, a higher proportion of people in this cohort were diagnosed with a cardiovascular disease (CVD) during the study period. These findings may not be consistent for Asian populations and could be partially explained by the variation in epidemiological data between the countries examined, among other factors. However, a national study for CVD screening has been conducted in China since 2013 and is part of the government\u2019s long-term effort to reduce the burden of cardiovascular diseases and cancer and improve the outcomes of those who are affected by them. In the long run, more focus is needed on controlling and reducing CVD diseases, including heart disease.", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\n- 14.6 6.6 4.6\n- 14.6 5.7 4.6\n- 14.6 6.2 5.1\n- 14.6 6.5 4.6\n- 14.6 6.4 5.8\n- 14.6 6.9 5.4\n- 14.6 6.5 5.7\n- 15.0 5.6 5.0\n- 15.3 5.0 5.3\n- 15.0 5.0 5.1\n- 15.5 5.1 5.0\n- 15.0 5.2 5.0\nYou would have 125-150 mg of potassium.\nIf you have type 2 diabetes, the average adult has a heart/stroke attack with a fatal outcome.

Another cause occurs when a person's body gets too much insulin from the pancreas.

Citing \"the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Cessation of smoking data from the United States and Canada reveal similar results. A person can be more than a ten-fold increased risk for the occurrence of future cardiovascular events,\" NICE's 2016 recommendation states.\n- Other evidence-based guidelines.

Crying less, more often.\nIt's important to be aware of any recommendations that apply to you. For example, do not eat less sugar.\n- High fat foods. People with type 2 diabetes should be careful not to eat a lot of high fat foods and should limit it as much as possible. High fat foods: foods, such as, fried fish, and foods high in saturated fat, such as, animal fat, cheese, eggs, butter, all nuts, whole cheese and high-fat cream. Limit the amount of red meat that you eat as much as possible.\n- Diets high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. People who have type 2 diabetes should limit these kinds of foods since they are not as filling as fruits or vegetables.\n- Too much tea and coffee. People who have diabetes should limit the amount of tea, coffee and other caffeinated beverages.\n- Sugary drinks. It is recommended that women of all ages drink no more than 400 mg of sugar per day. High sugar content in sugary drinks means a person is consuming an extra 25 g of sugar daily as the body absorbs more of it from its system.\n- Refined carbohydrate foods containing refined carbohydrates, such as white pasta, bread, and soft drinks, should also be avoided if you have diabetes.\n- Added sugars. People who have type 2 diabetes should limit both added sugar and sugar alcohols.\n- Soda drinks, such as diet soda. Sodas are popular beverages among children and adults. In the US, 120 million people have diabetes and only 25 percent of these have type 2 diabetes, while 90 million have pre-diabetes and 90 percent of those do not know it. These are the types where diabetes occurs. Therefore, people with diabetes should limit how much soda they consume. Sugary drink choices when you are thirsty: sugary drink choices: sugar free, fruit and low sugar drinks: carbonated water, herbal tea, milk and cream based 100% natural, herbal milks; and, dairy based products, such as cheese and ice cream.\n- Sugar alcohols. People with diabetes should limit sugar alcohols, such as saba or mannitol. People who have diabetes who consume no sugar alcohols should not exceed one-half the number of calories in any amount of sugar alcohol.\nIt is still important that you work closely with your physician and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to determine the diagnosis, determine which medication you need, and what kind of treatment options you can best find.

However, it is important to note that CVD risk doesn't just fall by the wayside as your health improves over time and new health issues emerge. As your health improves, so too does your risk of heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, and so forth.\nYou are an ideal candidate for managing your risk of CVD by treating risk factors and treating your condition properly.\nAs a consequence, it is advisable that your cardiologist takes a more active role in your care. They should be regularly consulted by your family doctor and that you also meet with them to discuss your overall health status and personal and family medical history. Your cardiac specialist will also perform a detailed evaluation and will discuss your risk of developing CVD, along with the various medications and treatments available for you.\nIf you are at particular risk, your cardiologist may recommend that you make dietary changes and undertake lifestyle changes to lower your blood pressure. Your cardiologist will also be concerned about any tobacco use and encourage you to quit smoking.\nYour doctor will also advise you on the best treatment for any heart failure which has developed as a consequence of your heart attack. By taking these steps, your risk of developing CVD will likely fall by the way you do it.\nIf you are at significantly reduced risk, you may be referred for additional treatment, including medication and diet, tailored to your needs.\nAs indicated, you are at very low risk of CVD, but as your healthcare needs change over time, it is also important to keep in mind that new, more serious conditions may present themselves as a result of changes in lifestyle or a subsequent flare up of CVD. You\nshould also contact your healthcare professional for any additional advice.\nThere are five stages to CVD;\nStage I - No symptoms or warning signs.\nStage II - Symptoms and warning signs, but no diagnosis or treatment is needed.\nStage III - A heart attack causes symptoms and may require certain treatments.\nStage IV - A heart attack is fatal.\nStage IV - Heart attack complications are major or life-threatening.\nStage I - No symptoms or warning signs.\nStage II - Symptoms and warning signs, but no diagnosis or treatment is needed.\nStage III - A heart attack causes symptoms and may require certain treatments.\nStage IV - Heart attack complications are major or life-threatening.\nStage IV - Heart attack complications are serious or life-threatening.\nWhat are the risks of a heart attack?\nIf you receive advice from your cardiologist that you do not need therapy for your heart attack, and you have some of the symptoms of heart attack, you may be able to access additional services and treatment.\nYou are not eligible to access:\nA blood test: Atrial fibrillation (Afib), heart failure and heart attack.\nCoronary angiography: A coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) may help by providing an opportunity for blood to circulate away from your blockage. This is an invasive treatment which can be done through an X-ray of the heart.\nHypertension: You can also use the CABG in your general practice as an easy, quick and comfortable option for many patients.\nYou are not eligible to access:\nCardiac catheterization: A cardiac catheterisation is a procedure used to take some of the blood out of your heart by placing a thin catheter into the heart. You may not have any symptoms but it is a good idea to contact your cardiologist to arrange this before your appointment is scheduled. You can also opt for cardiac angiography.\nA heart attack occurs if the coronary arteries that supply blood to your heart suddenly become narrowed or blocked, or your heart muscle itself becomes inflamed (lack of blood supply).\nAccording to our NHS guidelines, the treatment depends on how far the symptoms have advanced.\nHowever, in general, the treatment options vary depending on:\n- How long you have been taking high blood pressure and how well you manage it;\n- Your overall risk of heart disease and cardiac failure;\n- Your level of activity, how often you make time for physical exercise and how much you eat.\nIf you have these risk factors, you may benefit from taking action to reduce them. This can be as simple or as expensive as you wish for your cardiologist.\nYou may want to ask your provider to advise you on how to reduce risk factors to achieve these results, and in particular, reduce the risk of CVD from cholesterol lowering medication taking.\nFor information from our Cardiac Ambulance Service", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?\n- What are the major risk factors for CVD in Chinese individuals?\n- What is 'preferred' or 'latest' CVD risk management criteria?\n- How can CVD risk management be tailored for Chinese people?\nThe best time to get medical advice on CVD in Chinese is from a highly qualified, well-trained cardiologist.

However, research into the role of nicotine use in the development or progression of heart disease is only beginning to emerge. Smoking-related deaths are estimated to be increasing in the United States and around the world. According to the NICE review, approximately a third of US adults current users of tobacco and a quarter of British adults. Smoking is highly linked to cardiac disease. Smoking is the number one risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. More than two thirds of coronary heart disease and less than half of the non-CHD related deaths in the United Kingdom may be attributable to the tobacco-related harm caused by nicotine use. Nicotine is addictive, and if a product containing nicotine is used for an extended period of time, the nicotine can be metabolized to nicotine itself, which may then increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.\n- Klaassen M, Elfert C, Darmoni A, et al.

Lifestyle risk factors (dietary intake, smoking, and exercising) cannot be controlled by making dietary and lifestyle changes, but lifestyle measures such as exercise habits, smoking cessation, and managing blood sugar levels can be controlled using pharmacologic agents.\nA new study from Brigham and Women's Hospital has found that a simple blood-glucose-lowering medication may reduce the risk for death from heart disease. The new trial, from the first part of this year, was the first nationwide analysis of a specific, simple combination of two oral drugs designed to treat elevated fasting blood glucose levels.\nResearchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital and the University of Chicago Health Care study found that patients taking these drugs did not have greater risks of dying from heart disease or stroke than those not taking the drugs. \"These medications can be taken and used without difficulty, and may be effective in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases,\" said senior author Dr. Anita W. Kearney, MD. \"The research is an important step towards a safer future that includes drugs that offer the most effective therapy in combination while also meeting the patient's needs -- such as the choice versus the burden. We are grateful to those of you who have provided us with this crucial data. It is a small part of a larger study called ADAM, for Advanced Glycosylation Associated Modification of Metabolism, to look at how the body manages sugar.\"\nAlthough the study data are preliminary and cannot offer definitive evidence on why a new group of drug combinations led to reduced risk for death, scientists say that there are enough of these medications available to address this need.\n\"It's a small part of a larger study called ADAM, for Advanced Glycosylation Associated Modification of Metabolism, to look at how the body manages sugar and how we can use drugs to help manage this disease,\" noted Dr. Kearney. \"It's one aspect of an approach that we are excited about, by supporting new drugs to improve the survival rate of a disease previously associated with diabetes.\"\nKearney stressed her team's work was \"absolutely unique,\" and noted that prior to this new trial, the only drug combination that had been shown to improve mortality from cardiovascular disease were an \"oral dose of statins.\" \"I was pleased,\" said David Brownstein and colleagues, who reported that the drug combinations were not very effective. \"But when you look at this study, a new compound is already being developed, and it is more effective than statins, not a dose of statins you're gonna be taking,\" Brownstein explained.\nSeveral hundred participants took the study drug combinations, and 38% of the drugs were able to reduce the risk for stroke or death by more than 50%. After six months, 48 people in the group taking the 30-mg tablet and 14 people in the 20-mg tablet regimen -- also known as the \"Heterozygous\" and \"Incomplete\" groups -- had been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease.\n\"There was no effect of taking these drugs, and the statin treatments that were used did not reduce the risk for death or CVD from incident cardiovascular disease - 341 people in the Heterozygous group and 131 people in the Incomplete group. \"However,\" said Dr. Kearney, \"these additional drugs may be more effective in those who have an underlying history of CVD, and it is thought that these drugs may work better in those who suffer from a history of CVD.\"\nIt is very encouraging to see that these 38% of patients that have taken the new drug combination had a benefit on mortality, she said. \"The biggest question remains to be answered,\" she said, \"but this study supports the results of the study we previously reported in The New England Journal of Medicine.\"\nThe researchers believe that there are still gaps in their data. The new drug combination doesn't include new antihypertensive agents that have been shown to reduce CVD risk but have not been included in the new study, and no blood sugar-lowering drug combinations have been studied in combination with statin patients.\nDr. Kearney recommends that the \"", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?\nThese are the same guidelines provided by the NHS.

The following is a summary of the evidence about the importance of good nutrition and exercise for CVD management:\nPoor nutrition reduces good, medium and long-term outcomes\nImproved health outcomes in all people\nImproved general health with good lifestyle\nEvidence shows that good nutrition improves the quality of life in all people who have CVD. Improved health outcome in specific populations such as those living in urban deprived areas is most often related to the extent to which they have a positive nutrition or health-related lifestyle environment, including good physical activity habits. Improved health outcome in a wider range of community and local health contexts also links nutrition for CVD impact to social determinants of health such as housing, employment, quality of social environment and transport. People with CVD who have a healthier environment and lifestyle may actually have a more positive impact on their health than are those with a poorer environment and lifestyle (and are therefore more likely to get sick and die with CVD). This evidence is already available and based on a wide range of studies.\nYou are a healthcare professional whose goal is to improve the quality of life of patients with chronic diseases using evidence-based clinical practices. You make a personal decision about your resources (e.g. time, money) to use to achieve your goal. Does your choice reflect the most important or appropriate priorities or is it just a simple choice you can make?\nI believe that these three questions should be answered, at least in a general way. However, here is the link to the evidence that supports them, which is available here.\n- Which evidence supports the most important or appropriate priority and focus for patient interventions?\n2. How should lifestyle changes for patients with CVD with existing comorbidities be coordinated?\n3. Which evidence supports the most appropriate interventions to improve quality of life in patients with CVD who are being managed with established therapies that are associated with poor outcomes?\n4. Which evidence supports the most appropriate intervention for patients with CVD who are being managed with established therapies that are associated with poor outcomes?\nIf your healthcare professionals are not aware of the evidence, you may need help gathering this evidence. You may benefit by working through your healthcare professionals on the Evidence-Based Health Assessment and Improvement approach.\nAt the level of one person, I strongly support the use of lifestyle (e.g. physical activity, healthy diet, stress-management techniques), and good nutrition (e.g. appropriate amount of calories and nutrients) and a healthy lifestyle (e.g. good physical activity, smoking cessation and healthy alcohol consumption). However, I believe that there are important factors that require more attention and are not being included in the evidence for improved outcomes in patients with CVD. The reasons for this are:\nInclude adequate nutrition and exercise within your interventions to be successful in improving health outcomes in patients with CVD.\nInclude all people affected by CVD in your interventions to be effective in improving health outcomes (e.g. age, gender, race, income, health care provider, lifestyle habits and environmental/economic conditions).\nInclude all people affected by CVD in ongoing evaluation of your interventions (such as monitoring in the community).\nInclude lifestyle and nutrition interventions to improve health outcomes in all patients affected by CVD (or one or more of these populations).\nIf you are not in any of the above categories, you could do more for patients affected by CVD than we did in the Health Assessment and Improvement approach. You may also need advice on how to work through all these questions to achieve your goals as a healthcare professional.", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?\n- The following questions should be taken into account when considering options and treatments available for CVD:\n- Is the patient a candidate for CVD treatment?\n- Is the individual fit for the treatment or intervention?\n- Is there a particular person affected by the condition?\n- Is the risk of heart attack greater among them than among the general population?\n- Can the person in question understand the information provided?\n- Is the medication or intervention for CVD sufficient so that the individual can take it? If not, is there a recommendation on the benefits and risks of the treatment?\nYou can now read these questions in detail and better understand your patient's case.", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?\nWhen you do a KPI calculation, what if you have a NICE guideline on risk of coronary heart disease?\nWell, let me explain. Basically, a KPI is a ratio of two groups, i.e., a lower threshold (often 10%) and a higher threshold (12%) for a disease. But for high-risk people, what does a higher threshold mean?\nI have a good, but weak heart, and I have been smoking for a really long time. However, I have no diabetes, and I have no cholesterol. What risk have you taken? For me, it is low. For you, for me, it is high. Well, we can do more than just have an MCI, because there is no such thing as a heart attack. Also, I don't have a history of diabetes, so I can have a healthier heart.\nI take my diabetes off. I eat a lot of carbohydrates, but I don't have that type of diabetes. I have no hypertension, but I have low levels of cholesterol. That's good, because even though you have a high-risk of a heart attack, if your low levels of cholesterol aren't high, you are in a low-risk of cardiovascular disease, as I remember, and you don't have that high-risk. It is, I think.\nIt really helped me understand what a HDI is.\nQ. What a HDI is an assessment of blood cholesterol level?\nA. Since we started going beyond high cholesterol (hypertension or prehypertension) in my family a long time ago, I decided to have my HDI measured recently. By the way, I'm a 35 year old male. My LDL and HDL cholesterol are 236 and 209. I'm a 6'2\" male and I have no cardiovascular disease. What do I need to do about it?\nHere's a picture of your HDL, and then your LDL:\nHere's a picture of your triglyceride.\nMy HDL value was 450. My LDL value was 133. My HDL was up to half.\nMy LDL was 67. My HDL was up to half. That, of course, means that I have an HDL ratio of 3 to 1, right? This means, you have 3 good and 1 bad cholesterol in your body. If I have just two of them, then I have 2 bad cholesterol in my body. If I have 3 poor cholesterol in my body, then I have a higher number of good cholesterol in my body. The best thing would be to have a level of 100 when it comes to cholesterol.\nYour LDL is 80 mg/dL or lower. It's an atheromatogenic index. So for example, if HDL is higher than 40, that means there's a lot of cholesterol in your body. And if HDL is 90, that would mean there's an appreciable amount of cholesterol in your body. But your LDL is 20 mg/dL. This simply means that you have a lot of bad cholesterol in your body. You're not 100% protected, but you can lower LDL, and therefore still be protected from coronary heart disease - just don't get too high, right?\nNow, you're almost 99% protected. When you compare my LDL to your LDL you can see that it's only on one side, because my LDL had to come right down here to your level; my HDL was down here. When you compare, you should have a cholesterol count of 190.\nThis is not much to be concerned about. It's very clear.\nQ. How many years have I had high cholesterol?\nA. There are three kinds of blood cholesterol tests:\nthe first is called the \"Total Cholesterol.\" It's usually checked before going to the doctor, or at a pre-visit at a dentist. A lot of people use this as their cholesterol number, and they just use one number, but they're not sure what the numbers mean.\nThe second is called blood pressure. This is also a check of cholesterol. Usually you have a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg. That means, you have three bad cholesterol in your body, and you don't have a good blood pressure.\nAnd the third is the \"Total Cholesterol - Triglyceride.\" This is blood of your total cholesterol. There's one part that's called triglycer", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?
