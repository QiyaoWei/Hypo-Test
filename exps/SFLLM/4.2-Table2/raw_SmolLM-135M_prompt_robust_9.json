A long number is more likely to be a longer than the length of the height, and a short number is more likely to be a shorter number. \nAnd `Smokers` is how often the user had smoked.\n\nI'd really appreciate some assistance.username_1: The input was for the `Smoking status `of the person and did not include their height. `Height` is what we need and it is what we need from the first line for those that have a cigarette with that height because the users input entered the cigarette with their height. `Cigarette::name` will give you all the information you need because it will contain all the variables for the person. Your code will do you slightly better if you just copy it and put it in there and then reference the ` cigarette::name", "John has these features: Age: 59, BMI: 31.7, Blood Pressure: 134/68 mmHg, \n    Total Cholesterol: 3.9 mmol/L, HDL Cholesterol: 1.9 mmol/L, \n    Smoking Status: ex-smoker, Diabetes: no diabetes, \n    Family History of CVD: no, Ethnicity: Chinese.

It considers food factors and considers how different people can eat differently based on one's health, age, or weight, but does not include the weight management aspect. It also considers how different types of dietary interventions, e.g. diet modifications or lifestyle changes, can benefit the cardiovascular system as a whole or a group of people who live with heart disease. It recommends a diet based on a combination of foods, including fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, fish and poultry, and some oils and sweets\nThe heart-healthy diet aims to reduce the risks of heart disease, in a way that is also healthier. It does this with choices of food, with a good diet and some exercise. It also is linked to a longer lifespan, by reducing the incidence of chronic illnesses such as cancer. A healthy heart-healthy diet aims to eat foods, which have a low cholesterol and/or lower sodium content, which are low in saturated fat and/or low in cholesterol and/or sodium.\nThe Heart Healthy Diet (HHD) offers a diet that is low in saturated fat, includes protein from plants, and is rich in fibre and unsaturated fats. Some foods that are low in saturated fat, include fatty cuts of beef, cream, milk and yogurts. Foods that are high in fibre include legumes, legumes and whole wheat, such as brown rice, oats, oats and barley. Foods with a low sodium and cholesterol content include beans, fruits, vegetables, fish, and nuts. Some foods with a low salt content include potatoes, vegetables, butter, cream, cheese, milk and yoghurt. Food with a high-sodium content (e.g. crisps) include salty snacks, sauces, soups, canned soups, fried or deep-fried foods and foods high in fat, for example pastries.\nIt's recommended that a healthy heart-healthy diet include foods from every food group: fruits and vegetables\nThere are also foods which have a high fibre content, such as whole oats. Foods containing a low-sodium or minimal-salt content (for example, butter) are also recommended\nPeople need to increase their vegetable intake as it is rich in dietary fibre and can help lower cholesterol, both well-known benefits of the heart (and the general sense of wellbeing)\nA heart-healthy diet includes a diverse diet. The diet aims to provide a wide variety of food sources of nutrients and energy from each nutrient group in a balanced way. Examples of nutrient-dense foods include meat, fish, poultry, eggs, nuts and seeds, dairy products such as cheese, yoghurt, milk, cheese (plain, semi-soft) and tofu, fruits, vegetables (fresh, frozen and dried) whole-grains - bread, pasta, cereals\nHigh fibre diets\nThe following groups of foods are high-fibre foods; these include foods such as wholegrain bread, wheatpasta, oatmeal, wholemeal bread, rye, barley and bran\nLow Glycemic Index foods\nFoods containing a low Glycemic Index have a rapid rise in blood sugar level, which is useful for preventing blood sugar spikes, but not enough to cause an insulin reaction. Foods which have a low Glycemic Index are often whole grain and have a neutral or slightly sweet sour taste. This means their digestion can take longer and sugar taste may be more pronounced in the mouth, making the food less palatable. Low Glycemic Products such as white bread, white rice, white pasta and white rice muffins\nWhat foods are heart-healthy as opposed to heart-damaging?\nThere is not much evidence to support the claim that diet is more heart-healthy than diet, but a diet in this group can offer some protection against heart disease:\nCholesterol-free meats and fish that are low in saturated fat\nA low-sodium diet or sea food (fish is low in sodium)\nEggs are low in cholesterol and a well-balanced diet\nA low-calorie diet\nA low calorie diet means that it is eating fewer foods which make up an average of 300 to 500 calories, and increasing the food", "John has these features: Age: 59, BMI: 31.7, Blood Pressure: 134/68 mmHg, \n    Total Cholesterol: 3.9 mmol/L, HDL Cholesterol: 1.9 mmol/L, \n    Smoking Status: ex-smoker, Diabetes: no diabetes, \n    Family History of CVD: no, Ethnicity: Chinese.

We need to evaluate how well these factors explain the data which makes us look to take a health plan. Take this example. The person has a blood pressure of 147/96 with obesity and no smoking. So based on how much they want to get to their goals there are the following options: http://econ.bmj.com/content/86/11/906/full.full.pdf+html\nThese options include; a lifestyle change; diet; exercise; behaviour change; etc.\nThis is an example of the number of parameters which must be considered when choosing a lifestyle plan. The decision is made based on evidence, considering all the data and factors that contribute to one's results. This will be something that you can refer to if you need to.\nAs the person is given a lifestyle plan it is important to look at how well it describes the results with what it provides. Is there information which would be useful in your area which would show the effectiveness of this plan? You are going to need the information and it's been determined by someone that does the study who understands the effects of each of these parameters. This person is known as a clinician who has done an evaluation of your results and can advise you on what to look at.\nYou need to include a number of other factors such as your BMI, whether you will have other symptoms, your BMI and a number which will be associated with lifestyle. After you have looked at all of the parameters, make a selection of what fits the best. Then use this to design your treatment plan and explain how you would like people to understand it. This should tell the best thing to do!\nThe benefits of this method\n- Easy access, very simple, you will still be able to give a valid treatment plan to people with diabetes. We need to look at all the facts to make it relevant.\n- There is no need to spend your life reading out long lists of the symptoms and how it feels from these symptoms. You only need to use simple tests.\n- This gives a direct line to show the results as you will know what you have achieved.\nAdvantages and disadvantages\n- This is an easy to use approach for a large number of people as it can be done without any training.\n- You cannot go through the treatment method in the same way every time unless you have the information.\n- This method is difficult when the time is less. For example, there may be two treatments or even a week between them.\n- The use of the blood pressure cuff would be very cumbersome and would not allow the person to write them out.\n- This would reduce the benefits of carrying people away from the NHS (which is great for everyone!) and the costs.\n- You could have a 'quick and dirty' diet with only 500 calories as your diet or something more 'efficient' would probably have a lot of 'dangerous' calories such as fried potatoes.\n- For example, you might want to have a high fat based diet. This would also make it confusing for patients as it would be hard to understand which foods are 'healthy' and are actually bad.\n- There is often not much research done on this but, with the available data about obesity and diabetes, there should be evidence of what the benefits of this are. Also, the data is limited so it would take a lot of resources to do a long follow-up study on this as this would give valuable results.\nAs well as the data, you need to consider the following:\n- The lifestyle you want to be healthy - What do you like?\n- What have you seen in the past years have brought you back - what makes you feel confident? Do you have a positive outlook? Do people respond the way you want them to?\n- Do you like doing things that were stressful recently and are you able to cope with them? If you do, then this could be a good time to look at a different lifestyle. In a way, we are using this as a way of looking at yourself!\n- Are you sure that your health goal is the right", "John has these features: Age: 59, BMI: 31.7, Blood Pressure: 134/68 mmHg, \n    Total Cholesterol: 3.9 mmol/L, HDL Cholesterol: 1.9 mmol/L, \n    Smoking Status: ex-smoker, Diabetes: no diabetes, \n    Family History of CVD: no, Ethnicity: Chinese.

What is important to note is that all people with diabetes require medication to control their blood glucose levels, so it would probably be a good idea to advise them on what type and dosage of medication to take.\nUpvotes: 2 username_2: > \n> Is it more important that they had more than one medication?\n> \n> \n> \n\nYes. You likely want to have their blood pressure medication (blood thinners), diabetes medication (diabetic drugs like diabetes pills), ACE inhibitors (ACE inhibitors are a class of drug that block angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) which is key to controlling sugar levels in the blood), antihypertensives (medications that reduce the effects of high blood pressure), antiplatelets (medications that prevent blood clotting), cholesterol medications, diuretics, beta blockers, statins, and other agents to help control their high blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol when taken too high.\n\n> \n> What about that person is on multiple drugs if that causes him or her\n> \n> \n> \n\nIf this patient has not been diagnosed with diabetes and if there is no known reason for their type 2 (non-insulin dependent) diabetes he or she will need these medications.\n\n> \n> Can the patient have other forms of medications during this course of treatment if the\n>  number of these medications is greater?\n> \n> \n> \n\nThis is one answer. There is a growing amount of studies indicating that it is important to manage an individual's drug regimen. In the case of this patient, it would be helpful to have the possibility to do so. However, this option could lead to additional side effects for this person and cause them to be very confused about which drug regimen has to be avoided. It would also not be worth it if the number of medications the patient is taking decreases as time goes on as well.\nUpvotes: 2 username_3: **Update:** Since I recently learned that [<NAME>](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5365914/) and [<NAME>](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7284416/) did not recommend changing the diet, it would be too late for this patient. He was on meds for diabetes since 2003, and that was due to type 1 diabetes.

Based on these characteristics alone and ignoring everything else, such as the name, provide recommendations on CVD guidelines based on NICE for this person with CVD (n.d.).\n\nStep Three: Select the Appropriate Treatment Option\nBased on the results, NICE will select a guideline based on an individual person's cardiovascular risk profile. The next step involves identifying which non-nursing care professionals will be performing the assessment of this person with CVD. While we'll go through some general recommendations for each setting, it's crucial to note that every individual with CVD is unique and may respond differently to specific interventions. Therefore, NICE allows room for flexibility and tailored care suggestions in some settings.\n\nStep Four: Review and Integrate Interventions\nOnce the individual with CVD receives assessment and treatment guidelines, they undergo a careful review and integration process led by trained care managers. Through this continuous evaluation, these care managers adjust and refine the care plan based on ongoing data and real-time feedback. After successfully incorporating the care plan into the individual's routine, NICE takes note, ensuring ongoing adherence to prescribed interventions required by individuals with CVD.\n\nKey Guideline: Remember that while NICE supports the development and adaptation of individual care plans, these guidelines remain general standards and recommendations. Therefore, it's always important to consider various factors such as patient preferences, medical histories, and lifestyle factors before implementing any intervention.\n\nConclusion:\nAdminstrating individual care guidelines for someone with CVD involves thorough understanding of the patient's cardiovascular risks, understanding their personal preferences regarding care, identifying appropriate care providers, delivering care consistently, and integrating these care plans into the individual's routine care. By following this process, NICE aims to reduce healthcare costs and improve quality of life for individuals affected by CVD. With proper planning and application of individual care guidelines, even those with significant CVD vulnerabilities can receive compassionate, evidence-based care tailored to their unique needs.", "John has these features: Age: 59, BMI: 31.7, Blood Pressure: 134/68 mmHg, \n    Total Cholesterol: 3.9 mmol/L, HDL Cholesterol: 1.9 mmol/L, \n    Smoking Status: ex-smoker, Diabetes: no diabetes, \n    Family History of CVD: no, Ethnicity: Chinese. Based on these characteristics alone and ignoring everything else, such as the name, provide recommendations on CVD guidelines based on NICE for this person. There are many things that are important to address but they might be ignored. How could you have overlooked the important information?\n\n### \u2757What's the Best Solution?\n\nBased on the information we have here about the patient, I have chosen to refer her to a specialist. How should the patient be treated first?\n\nIf there is no family history of CVD, we should only worry about screening for CVD. We will start by screening for the risk factors, and then the patients' lipid profiles should be assessed. There is no evidence that lipid risk factor screening makes the patient worse. The evidence is that the cholesterol screening improves the patient's quality of life, their health condition, and increases their adherence to treatment. (Berger, 2012)\n\nIf the patient's lipid profile has high LDL level > 120 mg/dL, then we should focus on managing the patient with a low-lipid diet (which is usually low in fats and cholesterol). We should focus on lifestyle modifications to improve LDL levels for the patient (that's because the patient has already been taking statins):\n\n\u2022 Increasing physical activity\n\u2022 Reducing or eliminating or even stopping smoking\n\u2022 Decreasing alcohol consumption\n\u2022 Increasing a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables.\n\u2022 Taking antihypertensives and cholesterol-lowering drugs\n\nAfter reviewing all the above recommendations, we would recommend that the patient continue to follow the healthy lifestyle advice he or she has mentioned above.\n\n### \u2757How do we implement this decision?\n\nAfter reviewing all the information about the patient, we would recommend taking the patient to his specialist. We would then recommend that the patient take medication from their Pharmacist (at least every 4 weeks) so that they can see their doctors and can follow the recommended lifestyle changes.\n\nThe second recommendation is that the clinician should refer her patient to a specialist to address the other lifestyle recommendations based on the information. To ensure that the patient receives the correct medication, treatment, or lifestyle recommendations, it is essential that the following measures are taken by the patient:\n\n\u2022 Follow all medication regimens and dosages\n\u2022 Take as close to usual as possible: no more than 6 weeks\n\u2022 Never take medication with food\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn the case of the patient, we would recommend that she consult her doctors to manage her cholesterol if she has any of the above lifestyle changes. We would also recommend that her doctor check the lipid profiles in place and then prescribe the patient with a cholesterol-lowering drug or an antihypertensive (medication that lower your cholesterol levels) if the lipid profile is high.\n\n### References\n\nBerger, M.

He is a current smoker, does not have diabetes, but has a family history of CVD.\n- Ask him about his exercise habits and diet. John is generally a fit man who exercises regularly, but not very heavily. He has a sedentary lifestyle, and for his overall health and fitness, he recommends regular aerobic exercise such as walking or running at the local gym for 3\u20136 days each week.\n- Schedule a heart-healthy eating plan on a weekly basis. John is vegetarian, is a high-carb eater, and consumes lots of refined carbs to keep his body moving and keep his insulin levels low. John does not eat meat regularly and eats a lot of fresh fruit and vegetables. He also consumes plenty of fresh, unprocessed fish that makes him an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids.\n- Ask him to change his diet. The NICE guidelines recommend limiting his consumption of starchy carbohydrates for 3\u20135 days in the week since they contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes. John\u2019s intake of saturated fat is also higher than recommended, so he should increase his intake of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, as well as reducing the percentage of saturated fat in his diet. He should also increase his consumption of vitamin D through eggs and fortified cereals. John\u2019s exercise routine is moderate and should consist of 30 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise or moderate intensity activity (either a 20-minute walk or a vigorous 60-minute run) 3 times per week.\n- Follow the NICE guidelines to treat hypercholesterolemia. For someone with high blood cholesterol, he should follow the guidelines of the American Society of Anesthesiologists in treating hypercholesterolemia. John should be treated at least twice a year with statins, with the risk of developing cardiovascular disease also being a serious component of this treatment. The NICE guidelines recommend that a minimum 30% dose of statin medication is given once weekly, with a maximum of 100 mg daily. Patients with CHD who have undergone surgery must also take a statin medication every three months.\n\u201cTo my brother and uncle, I strongly endorse John\u2019s approach.\u201d\nDr. Alexis A.

What should be done to prevent cardiovascular disease and stroke?\nExercise and healthy diets are the best ways to prevent major cardiovascular disease. However, these recommendations are sometimes insufficient. The current Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension (http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg.4.3.6) and WHO (2018) recommend lifestyle approaches to improve well-being and lower the risk of high blood pressure.\n2.1. Lifestyle approaches to improve well-being\n- Eat a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and healthy whole grains, and limit sodium, saturated fat, and cholesterol.\n- Use exercise as part of the well-being plan:\n- Do aerobic activities at least 3 days/ week for at least 20 minutes with minimum five minutes rest between activities\n- Walk at least 30 minutes with moderate intensity, at least three days/week\n- Go for longer walks at different times of the day\n- Use low-intensity and low-moderate intensity exercises\n- Do yoga in your home or at a yoga studio where you can choose your own postures and get the recommended amount of flexibility\n- Regular, short-term, light-intensity exercise in the community (example 13-mile walking) or walking to work\n- Eat more foods high in vitamin D and calcium (for example, broccoli, milk, calcium-fortified orange juice, kale smoothies, and fortified many soy beverages\n2.2. Medication regimes to try and prevent or delay cardiovascular disease (CVD).\nMost patients with CVD get their blood pressure below the upper limit. Usually patients who have CVD have a healthy lifestyle and exercise regularly; however, for some reasons (for example, increased inflammation or a family history of CVD), individuals with CVD experience high or abnormal blood pressure. Antihypertensive medications lower blood pressure and help stabilize it (i.e. they are effective for 6-9 months.\n2.3. Some people should avoid certain medications\n- Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) or other hormonal contraceptives (hormones).\n- Antidepressants and some antipsychotics used for dementia.\n- Insulin. (Insulin causes the body to make more blood, which raises blood pressure. Some people benefit by using insulin as a way to control their diabetes, although the amount of insulin is regulated by genetic factors. Some drugs that cause the body to produce more blood may increase blood pressure, such as ACE inhibitors and diuretics. The medication choice for patients with heart failure may differ from others, based on whether the disease is reversible. Aspirin may reduce blood pressure temporarily, so patients\u2019 physicians must decide quickly which medication to prescribe.\n- Medicines that trigger or suppress the adrenal gland. In contrast to beta-adrenoreceptors, which cause the body to secrete adrenergic hormones, adrenocortical antidepressants cause the hypothalamus to increase cortisol which is then released into the bloodstream. This hormone triggers vasoconstriction and increases blood pressure.\n- Anesthetics. Aspirin or other CNS antiemetic (anti-diarrhetic) drugs cause excessive vasoconstriction which may produce vasodilation, blood pressure that stays high, and even cause rapid heart rate and other arrhythmias.\n- Blood pressure machines and devices (cardio-ventricular assist devices (CVAD)) that are connected to the central nervous system to help patients breathe and return blood to the body.\n- Catheter (catheter-assisted coronary artery bypass graft).\n3. How can patients use nutrition and lifestyle management to prevent or delay the development of CVD?\n3.1. Follow the instructions\nDieting and physical activity are some of the most important lifestyle changes needed to prevent and delay the development of CVD. Healthy eating is the single most important cause of weight loss; even small weight losses can contribute to weight gain over time.\n5.9. Eat more fruit, vegetables, and whole grains\n- If you are unable to cut foods down to a recommended portion of a day, then do them up to the recommended portion. (For example: one 450-calorie-per-day diet is equivalent to four servings of fruit or vegetables.) Eating as much as possible will help", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30.

He is a current smoker, does not have diabetes, but has a family history of CVD.\nTo screen for hypertension, John must be examined using a 12-lead ECG. The ECG should be completed with each follow-up reading, and the test data should be interpreted with the usual reference range of 100\u2013160 mmHg/s. Patients with normal ECG and the normal reference range (190\u2013250 mmHg) should be asked to perform 1) a T2 gradient echo (T1) in the left heart, which reveals an elevated left ventricular ejection fraction, 2) an in-vivo cardiac blood pressure cuff in a male patient with a BMI of \u226530, and 3) a T2 gradient echo in a case of hypertension. In the former case all readings should be interpreted within the normal range of blood pressure. The results should be consistent with or greater than the reference range.

He is a current smoker, does not have diabetes, but has a family history of CVD.\nMr John had a standard history and had been taking statins for 5 years. The blood pressure readings were 114/61 mmHg, the total cholesterol reading was 6.7 mmol/L, and the HDL cholesterol reading was 1.0 mmol/L. The doctor prescribed ACEi therapy (angiotensin receptor blockers) and he had his blood pressure and cholesterol levels checked. The results showed normal with a reading of 5.04 mmHg, a normal cholesterol reading of 3.06 mmol/L, and a reading of 4.31 mmHg systolic. A normal blood pressure reading was also seen with a reading of 3.877 mmHg diastolic. Mr John is also a smoker who has a family history of CVD due to smoking.

His physician is a well-known expert in the field of cardiovascular disease and hypertension, and he recommends these recommendations for John's needs:\nJohn's blood pressure should be ideally 114/61 mmHg, or less than 130/85 mmHg systolic (for people with a systolic reading greater than 90 mmHg, his physician uses an index of hypertension and recommendations are different. These guidelines indicate that 40% of patients with blood pressure over 130/85 mmHg in the UK should be treated with medication, and 85% of patients with 110/70 mmHg or below are treated with medication using a medication list, or a number of medications such as tablets or gels as a first treatment option.\nJohn doesn't have diabetes, but his physician and other members of his family have advised him to have his cholesterol checked every 5 years because he has two risk factors for coronary heart disease: a high cholesterol level (39 mmol/L or 120-130 mg/dL), and long-term obesity over the age of 40.\nJohn is also advised to undergo his cholesterol and blood pressure checks more often. He should have a cholesterol and blood pressure reading done every 4 years for the first 10 years, or once every 5 years for at least three years, and again annually thereafter. (If his cholesterol-raising cholesterol (the bad cholesterol) is high, the doctor may advise that the health record of the previous year should be re-examined.)\nThere are other health problems that John's doctor may consider as part of his prescription for his lifestyle changes:\n- Cardiovascular disease (2.1 %) - he has type 2 diabetes, and has high blood pressure.\n- Kidney disease - he has a history of chronic kidney disease (13.3 %).\n- High blood pressure - he has hypertension (26.2 %).\n- High blood sugar - he has diabetes, and hypertension.\n- Obesity - he has an eating habit that results in eating too much fast food, and having more sweets and sugary drinks.\n- Lack of exercise - he doesn't exercise, and his usual diet is mostly oily and salty, and his doctor recommends eating vegetables as a second part of his diet.\n- Sedentary lifestyle - he likes to be seated on the couch, watching television, working and is often not active.\n- Low-level radiation therapy - he has a history of radiation therapy that he has had, and a low level of radiation exposure.\n- He also reports that he gets sick more often than others in his family; if he had heart disease before he had cancer, he may be more at risk.\nThe guidelines have helped John to develop a healthier lifestyle in his home and family, so that he has a healthier lifestyle than what the previous guidelines could have.

The cohort study is one of the most comprehensive and comprehensive cancer studies worldwide. The British Cohort Study Group is an international group of people with cancer who were randomly assigned to take part in the study. They are part of the British NHS. During the study, there are two phases.\nPhase 1: This is when the people in this cohort are studied for a few years, at regular intervals. Then they are given the opportunity to continue their care, and continue to meet a research programme of the time. The cohort is then expanded to the entire population, and then the study is extended over more than five years, so that they can look past stage 3 of disease remission.\nPhase 2: This is when the study expands to 22-25 hospitals or medical centres, and they are then given the opportunity to participate in a trial of a new treatment. If they take part in this trial, they receive additional payments for the treatment. If they don't take part, the study will be stopped. There is ongoing recruitment in phase 2.\nPhase 3: As the study continues, more people take part in the study.

The patient does not experience atrial flutter, and atrial fibrillation is present. The patient\u2019s pulse is 86 beats/min, but his or her heart rate is 39 beats/min. There are no significant factors responsible for abnormal cardiac ECG findings; no significant coronary artery disease is seen, no abnormal heart rhythm, and no significant myocardial infarction has occurred. In the absence of coronary artery disease, the diagnosis is clinically viable. Thus, hypertension is a cause of chest pain.\nThe primary care physician will recommend lifestyle modification (see Prevention and Prevention) to reduce any new cardiac risk factors. Cardiovascular disease also is considered a risk factor if someone has been diagnosed with CAD within the previous 15 years. Some of the lifestyle modifications recommend are cessation of smoking, regular physical activity, weight management, and a heart-healthy diet. The doctor may also suggest some type of cardiac catheterization if it has been determined that a definitive diagnosis of CAD is not possible. There may be additional measures which need to be taken in order to improve the outcome for patients with abnormal cardiac ECG or if new findings would suggest patients are at an increased risk for other diseases.\nThe physician may also advise that there is a specific treatment program for a patient with an abnormal ECG. This may be an acute or more frequent event or may not need to be taken as a permanent solution. Since the disease progression occurs as the patient\u2019s heart rate increases (with a sudden increase of heart rate), this form of therapy usually provides symptom relief. In other cases, these medications may have a significant adverse effect on the heart rhythm due to a build-up of calcium deposit in the heart. With time, the calcium deposit may become unstable and cause a sudden death (known as a Myocardial Infarction). If the patient does not respond to medication, the patient may be suggested a cardiac catheterization (see Heart conduction system).", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30.

He weighs 160 kg (375 lb) with a BMI of 25.\nThe new guidelines are based on a systematic review of randomised controlled clinical trials and other research on the use of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs in cardiovascular disease (CVD). The results were published in the British Medical Journal on 21 February.\nThe study was based on the following outcomes:\n- A total of 15 studies comparing the effects of a statin or placebo on LDL-cholesterol concentrations.\n- A total of 10 studies comparing the effect of statins on LDL-cholesterol concentrations.\n- A total of 4 studies comparing the impact of statins on triglycerides concentrations.\n- A total of 37 studies comparing the efficacy of statins and statins plus other therapies or exercise in patients at high risk of CVD.\n- A total of 2 randomised controlled trials comparing the impact of statins alone versus a placebo. 4 of these trials met inclusion criteria, and 3 randomised controlled trials were excluded (none of which met the criteria; see list of excluded trials).\n- A total of 4 randomised controlled trials measuring the impact of treatment with 1, 5 or 10 years after statin initiation on LDL concentration were analysed. 4 trials measured both statin administration and statin treatment.\n- One study analysed the impact of statin therapy on the impact of cholesterol-lowering statins on blood pressure. 19 trials were included in the study. 11 trials measured the impact of statin therapy on the impact of cholesterol-lowering statins on blood pressure but only three trials were analysed (see list of excluded trials).\nAccording to NICE's Advisory Committee on Nutrition (ACN), the new guidelines are the result of a review of randomised controlled trials.\nThe findings from the systematic review supported the recommendations from NICE, the Cochrane Special Report on Statins, the European Commission's Medicines Agency (EMA) Panel on Pharmacotherapy, and the Royal College of Pathologists of the Royal Society of Medicine. For non-specialist clinicians the guidance suggests that recommendations for statins should be based on a good-quality evidence-based trial protocol and systematic review of the effects of statin therapy on LDL cholesterol.\n\"Statins, such as famciclovir and valacyclovir, work by affecting the molecular targets of cholesterol receptors,\" Dr. Alya M. Chowdhury, consultant cardiovascular physician at SRI Medical Center and member of the NICE Advisory Committee said, according to Medscape.\n\"Our recommendation is that anyone with elevated cholesterol should have their blood cholesterol checked, as there are a number of ways to do this. However, even the best-done test may not be able to tell you everything about your risk of stroke and heart attack. Therefore, further research should be directed at identifying treatment options that may be better than statin therapy,\u201d Professor Tzvi R. Vainbender MD, director of the National Lipids Prevention Centre at Israel Health Systems Hospital, Jerusalem, said.\nDr. Vainbender, who recently led the clinical work to create the new guidelines and is a member of the ACR, added that a high-quality study design is necessary to evaluate the effects of statin therapy on triglycerides.\n\"While we know that statin therapy may lessen LDL-C, the benefit of taking two to three years\u2019 therapy is unclear. Based on evidence from the clinical trials that this approach might lead to less progression to heart disease or cardiovascular events. Statins are effective in lowering LDL-cholesterol, so the effectiveness of statin therapy in terms of its long-term prevention of heart disease would be important,\" said Dr. Vainbender. \"Other important considerations are that statin medication is expensive, that the benefits are transient and that its side effects are typically mild. So, this latest recommendation is being well regarded by both clinical researchers and clinicians.\u201d\nThe new recommendations come just days after the release of the British Medical Journal's Guidelines for Cardiovascular Disease in 2016. The guidelines now cover the prevention of CVDs including heart attacks and strokes.\nNICE made the new recommendations as a result of a recommendation from the ACC and the Taskforce on Pharmacotherapy, and it also adopted advice from the TCDR (the Taskforce on Pharmacotherapy for Cardiovascular Disease) and the TCF (the Taskforce on Lipid Treatment Drugs).", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30. His blood pressure is 114/61 mmHg, and his total cholesterol is 6.7 mmol/L with an HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L. He is a current smoker, does not have diabetes, but has a family history of CVD.\nNICE recommends that he is commenced on lipid-lowering medication as he is asymptomatic and the risk of CVD is low (>10%). He is also on a statin therapy for heath reasons, the first of which is to decrease triglyceride levels to below 6.1 mmol/L (300 mg/L), the second is to decrease LDL (total cholesterol), and the third is to decrease total or reduced-density lipoprotein cholesterol. His current cholesterol level, measured by the FACE (lipoprotein analysis) statin therapy, is 126 mg/dL (7% [0.45]) with triglyceride levels of 125 to 126 mg/dL (16 to 22% [1.3 to 3.8]), and a current smoking status of 0 or 1. NICE should also advise him to quit smoking, and his current tobacco use is 2.9 mg/QL (15% [0.7 to 25.3]).\nGiven the above considerations, NICE recommends for John the administration of a statin therapy (thiomersal or simvastatin) starting from age 40 years. His current HDL cholesterol is 154 mg/dL (9% [0.6 to 14.6]). An upper limit of 7.5 mg/dL below which it is calculated to be clinically inadequate for coronary heart disease management was set (range: 0.7 to 120 mg/dL). If a recent clinical diagnosis of CVD (HCV) was missed, or if a previous clinical diagnosis of a cardiovascular disease (CVD) was not established; NICE may recommend a single dose of a statin therapy, or a higher dose; the latter of which depends on the medical history and on the patient's response to treatment.\nNICE also recommends a lifestyle intervention for cardiovascular disease, the first of which is lifestyle management of metabolic syndrome with weight loss and cessation of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption over the previous three months, and the second is, in addition to lifestyle recommendations, cardiovascular disease (including stroke), smoking cessation, regular exercise (at least 150 minutes per week for adults and children), and cessation of nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics. They recommend that he attend regular physical activity exercises (at least 30 minutes per day) and see a trained physical therapist. They also urge taking medications as prescribed by your health care provider.\nThe aim of the National Clinical Guideline development process was to create guidelines on evidence-derived cardiovascular disease prevention and management by 2015. The guideline development process included development of recommendations, evidence that they were based on evidence, and consultations with clinicians, patient advocates, researchers and the general population.\nA review of medical literature by the Advisory Committee on Medical Advice to Health Care Professionals in Cardiovascular Disease (the CAMS) found a limited number of guidelines, many of which were still controversial at the time of writing. There were several recommendations for diet that appeared to be well-grounded, but were not convincing evidence that they would reduce CVD and improved CVD were recommended. There were also recommendations for physical activity being recommended, but these appeared to be too complex for clinicians to understand and could be confusing. There were also recommendations for the management of diabetes and obesity, although the evidence around this was inconsistent and not as convincing as the recommendations for reducing blood pressure.\nWhile there were a number of recommendations, a number of recommendations were clearly unclear and some recommendations were not clearly supported by evidence. A number of references were reviewed and many of the recommendations were supported in the recommended amount and in the recommended type; for example, the recommendation for a 2000 kcal/day diet or a 2000 kcal energy-dense diet (healthy foods versus a Mediterranean style diet) appeared to be too broad and general. Also, the suggestion that diabetes mellitus is less a contributing factor to CVD than HDL cholesterol for cardiovascular disease prevention was controversial. The recommendation that people stop smoking and drink more alcohol has led clinicians and public health experts to ask questions about its potential benefits, and to suggest that it may lead to an increased risk of CVD that is associated with tobacco and alcohol smoking. Finally, the need for additional clinical information was not clear and some guidelines provided some insight into what specific care should be provided; for example, guidelines for the management of hypertension should be tailored to patients who are younger,", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30.

His blood pressure is 114/61 mmHg, and his total cholesterol is 6.7 mmol/L with an HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L. He is a current smoker, does not have diabetes, but has a family history of CVD.\nNICE recommendations recommend that people with elevated blood pressure and risk factors for CVD should have their weight, blood pressure, blood lipid profiles, blood sugar, and smoking status assessed every six months. In this study population where John's blood pressure was monitored through continuous monitoring, the blood pressure readings were >120 over 70 mmHg. They found that a total of 11% of those with elevated blood pressure were within the upper threshold for CVD.\nIt is worth pointing out that John has already gone from being at risk for CVD \u2013 it's not normal to have a high blood pressure of 40/110 mmHg. The most striking finding in John's blood pressure measurements was an elevation seen in 16% of individuals. That's pretty alarming! With this alarming prevalence, it's reasonable to extrapolate our findings to our population.\nBut even if 11% of John's blood pressure readings is a frightening threshold for CVD, it certainly is a high percentage for such a small group of people, and certainly could have resulted in a substantial change in their blood pressure readings.\nA 64-year-old man with an 850-millilitre (mL) blood pressure will take about 35 millilitres (mg) of a beta blocker medication every day. Given the potential detrimental effects of high blood pressure and diabetes, the patient is advised to continue taking this medication to maintain effective blood pressure.\nA study looking at the blood pressure readings found that just 5% of individuals achieved these blood pressure goals, which is well below the 640-millilitre (mL) target for diabetics. We found that if those two numbers were replaced with \u201cblood pressure levels.\u201d Then roughly 49% of individuals with hypertension would achieve this goal. For a more nuanced evaluation, it's worth looking at the following statistics for John's and the following statistics for those with diabetes:\n- 21% of John's blood pressure is treated for diabetes. He's already lost 38 days of blood pressure.\n- Since John's blood pressure is <30, he can expect his blood pressure to be <40 for that day.\n- If John's blood pressure is <40 a day, the patient would begin a two-year trial on the recommended dosage of beta blockers.\n- If John's blood pressure is 40 or more, the patient should be prescribed a beta blocker of 10 mg/kg/day.\nThe findings suggest that an increase in blood pressure as a result of the antihypertensive medication will be a reasonable approach to maintaining effective blood pressure. However, this finding is far from certain. The study participants who were on the AntiHypertensive Medicines Program were not enrolled for any of the different blood pressure monitoring and medication protocols described in this study \u2013 except in one case where a single measurement was used every eight days. Perhaps someone already had an increased risk factor for CVD, like having diabetes or being a smoker. But these findings suggest that the medication recommendations should be based on individual measurements, so they're not intended to be general recommendations and do not apply across different cardiovascular diseases.\nBased on these findings, we can conclude that John's blood pressure readings need to be monitored regularly, but he is at significantly increased risk for CVD due to the prescription of hypertension medication. Although John's blood pressure is controlled by the antihypertensive medication, he needs to make sure no other medication is in his blood to maintain a normal target level.\nDr. James L.

His blood pressure is 114/61 mmHg, and his total cholesterol is 6.7 mmol/L with an HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L. He is a current smoker, does not have diabetes, but has a family history of CVD. He has been following a diet and exercise plan for approximately two years to achieve weight loss, with a goal of losing 5% of his body weight. He was initially treated for his diabetes and hypertension.\nHow does he get CVD?\nJohn is a 70 man who has spent over three decades developing a fitness background, being physically and mentally tired. He has shown himself to be prone to developing heart disease and has been known to come down with mild to severe chest pains, which may develop into something more serious if not treated by a doctor with cardiologist advice. John has a 1000-1500 bp in his blood, and a low diastolic blood pressure of 100\u2013120 mmHg. Furthermore, his blood pressure is often higher than that of the majority of his patients. In the past, his blood pressure is usually within a range of 900 bp/L. He has always known that he needed to begin a new lifestyle, which includes losing weight, cutting down on alcohol, and quitting smoking. He has been asked about ways to lose weight. With the right advice, they will help to reduce his blood pressure to below 140/90. John is now determined to be fat free for life and has been prescribed to be low carb; his primary care doctor has suggested high carb consumption, but there would be no reason to suspect that his body was not capable of maintaining such a low blood pressure. It is now clear that high fat consumption can do more harm to his heart that high carb consumption can. That is why John\u2019s diet includes a wide range of vegetables and some whole grain foods, a low carbohydrate diet comprising predominantly high fat dairy with lots of protein, and other foods such as oats and nuts and some plant oils (especially peanut and avocado oil).\nWhat symptoms can it cause?\nWhile many heart issues are linked to stress, in John\u2019s case, it is also associated with stress. A large percentage of his case have suffered from panic attacks. These often start suddenly and feel as if the heart has stopped beating. When John\u2019s blood pressure suddenly drops to 140/90 systolic and 95/62 diastolic, he may struggle to have a conversation. Over a period of six months, John is diagnosed with acute heart failure and has had their primary care physician monitor him. A further 23.7% of patients who have a heart attack (94.6%) have had problems in the preceding 24 hours. In these cases, John\u2019s diastolic blood pressure tends to be higher than normal, which may damage his heart for a period of two years, causing him to require mechanical ventilation.\nWhat can we do about it?\nIt would be best to start at a low enough weight level to gradually build up, as John is a teenager and his body is still developing. In my opinion, it would be more practical to start at a 75 lbs (45 kg). Firstly, be aware of the health risks which are associated with hypertension. These may include heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, heart failure and heart attack complications. When diagnosed with a heart condition, it is now possible for John to be given a higher dose of medicine than the recommended adult dose, this may be necessary in order to help prevent further complications. In order to avoid the potential for this to happen, John should be monitored for a 5-14 day period where he starts to exercise every day, and does up to 3 times a week for 10 to 15 minutes. Also, all of the medicines that John is now taking must be taken at the exact time they were given in order to avoid any possible side effects. If you are considering that a course of medication may be right for you, your doctor can give you more information about this and advice on how to manage this.\nIt may seem as though every heart condition is different and will require different treatment approaches, therefore it is important that you consult your doctor in a specific fashion. He or she will be able to explain the importance of taking medicines regularly, and ensure that they are taken on time so that you can enjoy your life to the fullest. It would be highly recommended to try and take a high quality multivitamin and vitamin D supplement. Many of the supplements we recommend here are not just necessary, but beneficial.

This can be useful to identify whether they have cardiovascular disease and determine what treatments they are referring for. If this information has taken a toll on your patients it may help inform them about their condition and suggest which types of treatment they could be offered for it.\nG. Explain in the context of CVD and to the patient an explanation about the importance of understanding the importance of high cholesterol and of managing that cholesterol level.\nI. What kind of patients do you think would benefit from discussing cholesterol?\nA. A healthy person should have an LDL (LDL-cholesterol) level of 50 to 60 mg/dL at rest, whereas a low cholesterol level of 60 to 70 mg/dL is an example of a high cholesterol state. People with cholesterol levels of 110 to 129 mg/dL are defined as having a relative risk of coronary heart disease of 20 to 25 per 10,000 person-years.\nThe AHA states that a person who has a high risk of heart disease is at a significantly increased risk of developing complications from heart disease. For example, high cholesterol has a strong association with coronary heart disease, heart attack and stroke, both as a cause of heart disease and as a consequence of heart disease.\nWhat are the main factors that increase the risk of an individual having a heart attack or stroke?\nSome factors, such as age, gender, high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, obesity, physical inactivity, family history of heart disease, pregnancy, high cholesterol, having a family history (for example, mother has angina) that might increase the risk at an early age, and having other metabolic disorders such as thyroid disorders are thought to play roles.\nHigh cholesterol is also a major factor in type 2 diabetes in older people.\nFor an individual who has high cholesterol, and is taking an effective regimen for it, your patients will most likely be surprised to learn that cholesterol can be controlled through lifestyle factors. And, there are a number of ways a patient can determine their cholesterol levels. These include the self-reported or doctor ordered measurement, a fasting plasma cholesterol test or a patient blood test.\nWhat else can affect a patient's cardiovascular health?\nAge, stress and physical inactivity are of major concern to the patient.\nIf a patient has a family history of heart disease, especially if the family member has been diagnosed with high cholesterol or a heart attack or stroke, the patient should check with their doctor regularly to see if the patient has a high or borderline cholesterol level. If the patient does have a high cholesterol level, the patient should follow the treatment guidelines provided to them by their doctor. If a patient has diabetes and hypertension, then the individual should have their blood pressure checked. If their blood pressure is considered borderline, or if they have type 2 diabetes, then the patient should discuss this with their doctor.\nWhat are lifestyle changes that, if implemented correctly, might help the person lose weight and reduce their cholesterol level?\nA high cholesterol can be prevented or managed successfully by eating a heart-healthy diet and by following a healthy lifestyle with a variety of physical activity.\nYou will need to give appropriate dietary advice if you are concerned that a patient might have high cholesterol.

Can you link and explain what the authors are trying to demonstrate here? The reasons for the link are:\n- In most cases, when people with severe CVD have another heart condition, one needs to take extra precautions and follow a more stringent control of cholesterol, blood pressure and sugar\nThis will usually help reduce the incidence of fatal heart attacks as well as prevent more serious cardiovascular disease complications like heart failure from developing\n- And to prevent the disease from worsening, the risk factors associated with heart failure can often be reversed\n2010 Mar 4 - The Lancet (UK National Library of Medicine/WHO) described the epidemiology of heart failure in China.

A major cause of death in China is heart failure, with a mortality rate of 45% and a life expectancy of 63 years.\nThis is described in your article as follows, where the authors state:\nIt is becoming clear now, however, that mortality is a consequence of a complex set of factors, such as disease patterns and the environment, leading to health inequalities despite the prevalence of certain health conditions\n\"There are, in fact, numerous social factors that are linked to heart failure, yet they have neither been explicitly recognized nor the underlying medical conditions covered by the ICD\"\n2010 Jun 20 - In her paper, The Lancet (Lancet) reports that \"the proportion of deaths due to cardiovascular", "Considering John's demographics and health status - a 70-year-old Chinese male, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, free of diabetes, with a family history of CVD - what would be the NICE CVD guidelines applicable to him?", "Considering John's demographics and health status - a 70-year-old Chinese male, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, free of diabetes, with a family history of CVD - what would be the NICE CVD guidelines applicable to him?\nQ3 - A study by 1912 indicated that a BMI of 28 was classified as obese.

If we are referring to the 'good and healthy' category, the NICE guidelines are most appropriate as\n1. The criteria for the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, which include the symptoms, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings and end-organ damage assessment, are based on the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) 'CVD' guidelines.\n2. The criteria for the identification of cardiovascular diseases are based on the NHIS CVD guidelines, which include all the clinical features suggestive of CVD, such as the presence of CVD, the severity of CVD, and the duration of the condition. These criteria are based on NHIS guidelines and NCST guidelines.\n3. The treatment for cardiovascular diseases is largely the same as those for other diseases.\n4. The treatment of cardiovascular diseases is simple: blood pressure control, blood lipids control and smoking control. If these steps are followed for all the cases of cardiopulmonary diseases that are included in the 'good, healthy' category, and the criteria for cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death are met, the condition can be treated in 8-12 weeks, while the other complications for these diseases can occur within 6 weeks.\n4. The treatment of cardio-vascular diseases as part of the 'good, healthy' category needs to be tailored to the patient's lifestyle and any specific concerns regarding cardiovascular disease. The treatment of cardiovascular diseases should be started in the first months of a patient's life and can be done with lifestyle interventions and treatments.\n5. Heart attacks can be managed in a few days only (depending on the specific circumstances), while cardiac arrests are irreversible and can occur even minutes to hours after a heart attack occurs. The treatment of cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death, according to the 'good, healthy' category, is similar to the treatment of other cardiovascular diseases, but requires a patient's cooperation with medical staff.\n6. If heart attacks are treated with anticoagulants, the treatment of stroke is very similar (at least 2 weeks after diagnosis), whereas the treatment of cardiac arrests is quite different.\n7. There are two main treatment methods for stroke that are based on the guidelines of the NICE guidelines: if we have ischemic stroke, we can use anticoagulants, while if we have a hemorrhagic stroke, we can use antiplatelet therapy or thrombolysis. In addition, if the patient has a heart attack, we can use antiplatelet therapy, thrombolysis/thrombolysis and cardiac cath.\n8. The treatment of stroke depends on the severity and time of the condition. If the condition is mild and the risk is low, anticoagulation is recommended as the treatment; on the contrary, if the condition is severe and the risk of bleeding is high, thrombolysis/thrombolysis and the use of anticoagulants cannot be recommended; in the absence of anticoagulation, we can use antiplatelet therapy or thrombolysis/thrombolysis, depending on the indications.\n9. If the diagnosis of stroke is made on the basis of clinical presentation (such as blood pressure is persistently lower than 100/60 mmHg, which is the NICE CVD guidelines), a clot in one of the deep branches of an artery could be the cause of the stroke, thus we should stop the supply of oxygen- and nutrient-rich blood to the brain, while it should be known during the diagnostic process that the clot in the deep branch is located where the carotid artery meets the vertebral artery or a large artery that branches from the aorta to the brain. If an embolization procedure is applied, it is needed to stop the delivery of oxygen-rich blood to the affected portions of the brain (where the clot is located).\n10. The treatment of severe stroke depends on its severity (such as stroke in 1 mmol/L is considered severe if it affects 50% of the left ventricle, while in 50% of the left ventricle it affects the 90th to 95% of the left ventricle). If the treatment of stroke is severe, endovascular (through the femoral artery) embolization, vascular artery stenting, and/or carotid endarterectomy are performed depending on the circumstances, or the treatment of severe stroke is based on the 'good, healthy' part of the definition. The treatment of ischemic stroke, according to the 'good, healthy' category, can include a blood transfusion, medication, or surgery.", "Considering John's demographics and health status - a 70-year-old Chinese male, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, free of diabetes, with a family history of CVD - what would be the NICE CVD guidelines applicable to him?\n\nAnswers:\nnice to hear, as you might expect that the NICE criteria should be applied to those with a BMI of over 30, as it's quite rare!\n\nAnswers\n\nIt should be more specific to those at risk for CVD but there is such a thing as risk factor - that can explain some differences, but not all.

For example, people with a history of heart attack or stroke, but are not yet known to have a history of CVD, are referred to as'modifiable risk factors.'\n\nThe NICE have not yet given a standard definition of CVD because, until NICE have looked at the evidence, I think it would be unproven to even define a particular cause of CVD, that is why I don't question the conclusions and the decisions I have made with regard to which ones to focus in a current report. I believe we would eventually be able to identify the common factors which contribute to the development of CVD by studying the results of controlled trials that have been done on this issue.", "Considering John's demographics and health status - a 70-year-old Chinese male, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, free of diabetes, with a family history of CVD - what would be the NICE CVD guidelines applicable to him?\nA. In the context of the 2016 NICE guidelines, a primary care provider can do the usual patient care steps, such as assessment, diagnosis, and treatment including:\n- taking a patients medical history including asking questions about his overall health\n- performing a full physical examination - as in a primary care provider, assessing for all of these areas; for a primary care provider\n- doing a physical exam such as chest x-rays, cardiac/mood check.\n- performing a physical exam including a screening blood pressure, examining chest x-rays, examining feet and ankles and performing a comprehensive physical with a cardiologist, taking a patient history, performing a full physical examination - as in a primary care provider, assessment\n- doing a physical exam such as a full health review to assess for possible medical causes of symptoms, the presence of other potential disorders like cardiovascular disease, the potential presence of drug toxicity, chronic renal failure, liver disease, vitamin deficiencies, autoimmune diseases etc. (this is more useful in assessing these patients, especially if the patient is age < 65 years)\n- using medical tests to observe the patient in clinical settings and to diagnose possible disease processes and determine the likely course of the patient's disease.\n- monitoring the patient's general health status, such as checking for signs of heart failure, hypertension or renal disease.\n- using tests to observe the patient in their early years.

Then, if the data can be shown with a risk-based approach to give advice, then the next step is to design a plan for the person. This is what is a \u201crisk-based\u201d approach.\nThe purpose of a risk-based approach is to identify the biggest risk factors for health problems (for example, high blood pressure, smoking, overweight, high blood cholesterol, etc.) and, while following this, then plan the next step. (For this, you would need your patients\u2019 history, their medical history, the patient\u2019s and their families\u2019 medical history, blood pressure, age, comorbid health history (such as diabetes, etc.), cholesterol level)\n- If NICE is to assess for coronary heart disease in elderly patients, then your initial question with your patients would be \u201cWhat lifestyle habits do you consume that might increase the risk of heart disease?\u201d With regard to high blood pressure, your initial question would be \u201cWhat types of alcohol and sodium may you consume to reduce the risk of heart disease?\u201d This is an easy question to ask. When you have examined your data, you would have identified 5 or 6 different lifestyle habits. Your discussion would be about your choice of the 5 lifestyle habits. With regard to high blood pressure, you might mention that you typically consume \u201c240-250 mg/d of sodium a day\u201d. You might identify a \u201c1700-2400 mg/d sodium a day\u201d as your \u201clifestyle plan\u201d.\n- What are the other factors you currently do not control or try to control? Remember that a list of things you would do, or not do, is called a \u201crisk-benefit\u201d analysis or \u201crisk-reduction\u201d analysis. These will involve assessing your blood pressure and cholesterol levels for any risk factors that you can control. The main thing to keep in mind with regard to dietary habits is that they could, of course, play a major role.\nLet's look at the steps in a risk-based approach. Your first step might be to assess your risk factors (high blood pressure, for example, or coronary heart disease, or heart failure). The next step would be to identify 5 or 6 lifestyle habits. You might, for example, tell your patient \u201cI'm currently eating a lot of red meat (beef, pork, lamb, chicken, etc.). I would recommend having a meal plan that has just 50 percent healthy fat, plus no more than 3 grams of saturated fat, for example, and no more than 5 grams of saturated fat, for example. You might also recommend a new energy- and fiber-loading diet that is 60 percent fat, plus for example fruit and vegetables. Then you would evaluate those habits.\n- If your patients have cholesterol levels over 100 mg/m2, you will need to develop a plan for changing their cholesterol levels. You would need to discuss what your targets are when LDL is above 100 mg/m2 and HDL is below 70 mg/m2. Also discuss those factors with your patients, along with your health history, their medical histories. If your cholesterol levels are below 150 mg/m2, you will not need your cholesterol levels for cholesterol testing.", "Considering John's demographics and health status - a 70-year-old Chinese male, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, free of diabetes, with a family history of CVD - what would be the NICE CVD guidelines applicable to him?\n3.

If you had to pick one of the guidelines, do you think it would be important for John to improve?\nHealth professionals' recommendations\nThe evidence concerning the role of lifestyle changes and interventions in the reduction of CVD is rather limited. It remains only to assess which of these interventions will reduce the risk of heart disease and to do so. There have been multiple surveys in recent years regarding the effectiveness of preventive lifestyle interventions. Although most studies are of low methodological quality, all of them have shown that interventions that are aimed at weight management or physical activity are more effective than no intervention. Some studies did not achieve results at all. Other evaluations have provided little to no improvement in blood pressure during a particular period of time. In view of poor quality studies, it is not enough to set up an intervention. The effectiveness of lifestyle interventions needs to be evaluated, whether this involves randomisation, assessing individual differences, monitoring outcomes after intervention and, in the case of obesity in particular, the benefits of individual lifestyle interventions.\nThere has also been conflicting evidence linking a good lifestyle to reduced risk of heart disease. It has been shown that high-fat, high-salt meals, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, being overweight, smoking, and alcohol consumption all increase the risk of heart-related events. There is also insufficient evidence on how exercise and physical activity affect the risk of CVD. Some studies have shown that it can be beneficial for maintaining long-term cardiovascular health. There have also been several reviews and meta-analyses of lifestyle interventions and cardiovascular events. For example, exercise alone can have a protective effect in relation to risk of heart-related events, but the effects differ from one individual on another. It is likely that the protective effect of exercise may not be completely neutralised by physical activity over long periods. Therefore, the evidence is limited, although a reduction in risk may be beneficial. As for lifestyle factors, physical activity, smoking cessation, controlling for weight, controlling for alcohol intake, and controlling for medical conditions other than smoking, however, may be more useful for reducing a person's risk of CVD.\nDietary and physical activity recommendations\nStudies of the effect of a nutritionally adequate diet, physical activity, exercise and/or smoking cessation have provided limited evidence regarding the relationship between nutrition and CVD. A large number of randomised controlled trials reported reduced risk of CVD if an overweight or obese person followed an adequate diet and/or lifestyle, but there is no evidence of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of health interventions focusing on a large and robust population. In the case of a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, for example, this would produce an adverse effect. Most studies have been cross-sectional.\nOne study from Finland compared a high-fat, low-cholesterol diet with a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet. It reported a significant reduction in risk of incident CHD and death, but the effect was not as large as some other studies, and the effect was only marginally beneficial. Most of the nutrition recommendations on diet and lifestyle were based on some kind of diet, for example a vegetarian diet and consumption of fruit and vegetables. These recommendations still provide limited evidence regarding a diet that is healthy for CHD.\nThe recommendations for physical activity, on the other hand, do not provide much information. These recommendations, as used for health promotion and disease prevention, may represent the best approach regarding physical activity. However, there can be some limited benefit for this recommendation for CVD prevention. More recent studies have identified a substantial adverse effect of physical inactivity. Many studies have shown that higher physical activity, compared with resting, is associated with a lower risk of CHD, that a lower fat diet is associated with lower risk, and that a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet is associated with lower risk of CHD.\nOverall, there is no conclusive evidence regarding diet and physical activity recommendations from nutrition or physical activity. For example, the results of clinical trials with obese healthy persons for the intervention effects of diet and lifestyle recommendations have been inconclusive at best. The most available information on physical activity recommendations comes from cross-sectional studies. The evidence on diet and physical activity recommendations for other groups of individuals remains limited. It is difficult to predict which strategies will be more effective over time. The main recommendations may be that we should increase physical activity in young people and more nutritionally adequate diet for healthy children. Recommendations for physical activity need to be more specific to individual activities. The recommendation for physical activity may not correspond to the recommendations on physical activity for CHD prevention, because it is based on the assumption that there are some physical activities people", "Considering John's demographics and health status - a 70-year-old Chinese male, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, free of diabetes, with a family history of CVD - what would be the NICE CVD guidelines applicable to him?

This stores the fat from your liver, fat from your muscles, and fats from other internal organs. Some fat is found in the cells of your inner organs. Your body stores the fat in response to food and the threat of hunger. This causes the liver of your stomach and small intestine to function normally, while the fat inside the stomach, other cells in the intestine, and fat from the internal organs is used as fuel. If the fat is not used it is stored in areas of the body where it is not needed, like in the arms, or kidneys, or liver.\nThe World Heart Federation recommends that CVD risk be assessed before any medication for the treatment of CVD. CMR may be recommended for a patient with a history of CVD, or a history of a heart or/and vascular disease risk in the family. CMR is likely to be considered when patients have symptoms suggestive of a CVD, and in those patients who cannot be managed through self-management and/or medication. However, patients need a history of CVD, or a history of a related vascular disease, so the decision is made after examining the medical records and discussing the risk factors identified in the risk assessment.\nWe have found it difficult to know exactly how well the patient is doing on the exercise program, at what point he may need to adjust it.

While the doctor was looking at the patient\u2019s exercise records from 28 March 2018, or as recently as April of this year, we didn\u2019t give his blood pressure more than 10 to measure his heart rate.

Once you understand your medications and diabetes diagnosis, it just will not be difficult to get them to be aware of their importance, and in some cases, actually encourage them to do so. Some medicines may be needed in addition to others and the individual with diabetes can need all the help he or she may need.\nIn my experience, the more we understand the disease, the more we can help to avoid, minimize and even reverse the disease. Understanding that, rather than giving a patient the \"wrong\" information or telling him that a new diet plan would not be \"safe\" to eat, we would instead offer the patient, \"The diet plan has been worked out with you\" so that the patient could then focus on the \"right\" plan for him or her. This will allow us to keep a close eye on their progress and in many situations even prevent further harm.\nSome people with chronic heart failure who develop exercise intolerance find it difficult to change their diet if their goal is to lose weight.

When asked what is the standard recommendation for CVD prevention in this patient (i.e. the guideline), what is it?\nThe guidelines are for CVD prevention and management in primary care settings, not at the individual level. They describe a list of potential interventions in primary care settings and are intended to be used by primary care professionals in primary care settings.\nWhat is the current NICE guideline for CVD prevention in primary care settings?\nThe current NICE guideline for CVD prevention in primary care settings is a 5 part model showing two components. The first part focuses on maintaining a healthy eating pattern and is applicable to primary care settings. The second half of the guide covers the most commonly used risk factors for CVD development in primary care. As its aim is to be used by primary care professionals, the guidelines are expected to be able to be used by primary care doctors.\nWhat is the recommended approach to prevent new CVD cases in primary care settings?\nAs the population of primary care doctors is ageing rapidly compared to the general population. There is a need for routine interventions, in particular targeting cardiovascular risk factors, that are used as prevention strategies in primary care settings in the UK. To accomplish this they should firstly be able to take into account the most common causes of CVD in the general population and make recommendations for prevention for the general population.\nThe recommendations are based on the use the four components of the model in the NHS. In primary care settings they focus on lifestyle interventions. Lifestyle interventions include:\n- Lifestyle change: Reducing the risk factor of CVD, i.e. smoking, eating a healthy diet, and stress-management;\n- Reducing the risk factors of CVD, i.e. obesity, type II diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smoking.\n- Reducing the risk factors for death and the overall health care spend which includes reducing the risk factors of smoking (e.g. smoking cessation is one of the main objectives of the NHS).\n- Promoting a healthy weight, and reducing the risk factors of dyslipidemia, a lipid-lowering therapy to prevent CVD or other related health problems.\n- Reducing the risk of smoking (e.g. through changing your behaviour to not smoke \u2013 e-cigarettes and e-liquid)\n- Reducing the risk of diabetes (eating a healthy diet and increasing physical activity)\n- Reducing the risk of hypertension (high blood pressure)\n- Reducing the risk of dyslipidemia (high cholesterol and/or triglycerides)\n- Reducing the risk of smoking and the physical activity related to it.\nWhat are the main points to remember when taking a new heart disease preventative measures in primary care settings?\nThe key points of taking a new heart disease preventive measures in primary care settings are mainly (in order to facilitate communication and cooperation at the general practice level):\n- Having a discussion about the most common risk factors for CVD\n- Sharing the most important findings around CVD risks (with the client first)\n- Emphasising preventive lifestyle actions, together with the results and treatment of the disease\n- Setting realistic goals for the patient\n- Agreeing on an action plan for each new action. Discussations are often more effective when the patient is more positive with regards to their role in the prevention\n- Having the role of the health care professional/doctor informed of whether the patient wishes to take a new heart disease preventive measures in the NHS.", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him? Use the NICE guidance below 2 weeks after diagnosis. Note: There is a variation in the NICE guidance according to age (as discussed above).\nRecommendation: Lifestyle modifications/quitting smoking\nSmoking was not assessed to have an effect on blood pressure or on the incidence of CVD. Lifestyle modifications or quitting smoking (if appropriate) should be considered for those who are smoking moderately or smoking regularly. This includes any patient who has a BMI of over 30, has coronary heart disease, history of stroke, diagnosed with diabetes or a history of smoking.\nRecommendations for blood pressure, HDL, total cholesterol; and LDL particle numbers\nUse the NICE guidance below.\nRecommendation: Aspirin or oral nitroglycerin tablets (pancotin) if necessary\nThe results of the 2 studies in the NICE guidance are available here.\nThere is no clear association between aspirin/anticoagulant (A/AC) therapy for low-intensity heart failure and the risk of CVD and the risk of death from CVD is unclear.\nRecommendation: Aspirin/anticoagulant therapy for MI is not likely to reduce the risk of CVD.\nTreatment of diabetes and/or hypertension\nThere is limited research evidence for either treatment of diabetes or hypertension combined with heart failure.\nRecommendation: Treatment of diabetes and hypertension\nIt\u2019s always best to talk to your pharmacist about the potential benefits and risks of lifestyle modification before starting medication to reduce heart failure risk.", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him? There is very little debate on the importance of maintaining these types of lifestyle behaviours which are associated with the prevention of CVD.\nThe focus of the guidance under the NICE guidance includes lifestyle modification in both the prevention and treatment of CVD. This is underpinned by three elements: (a) reducing LDL cholesterol; (b) decreasing the risk of developing heart disease; and (c) having a healthy lifestyle free of risk factors. However, a major area of debate is the role of physical activity on reducing CVD. There is a great deal of literature now supporting the potential of low to moderate level physical activity to reduce the severity of CVD, reduce cardiovascular risk, and even reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events and death. This makes it a particularly relevant exercise regime for people with CVD and their family members as well as all those who wish to improve their chances of living healthy longer. It is likely, however, that a healthy lifestyle includes not only regular moderate to vigorous activity, but also other, less intense activities.\nThere is now a wealth of evidence supporting the beneficial effect of physical activity on CVD prevention. A good exercise programme can have important beneficial effects on CVD risk factors. However, when implemented appropriately and in the context of risk factors, physical activity alone is able to reduce the risk to a point where exercise and CVD prevention make sense.\nThere has been some debate about the timing of physical activity in relation to CVD prevention. With only very few people showing the significant improvement in CVD risk factors in previous life-time trials following vigorous exercise over gentle activity, there is considerable concern about the timing of physical activity. This is because the evidence is not conclusive on the optimum timing of exercise. The evidence is also conflicting about the timing, intensity and duration of activity, with the most common explanation being that intensity and duration should be between the training sessions.\nThis means that the benefits of physical activity are likely to vary over time. In principle there is little difference between moderate to vigorous physical activity and less vigorous physical activity and yet there is considerable evidence supporting the benefit of greater intensity over a more gentle duration.\nAs part of their exercise guidance the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention also includes recommendations for the implementation of personalised exercise interventions. A number of studies suggest increasing physical activity, particularly if the exercise is of high intensity, decreases the risk of CVD, irrespective of type of lifestyle.\nThe evidence for the efficacy of individual components of physical activity to reduce CVD risk for people with CVD has been mixed. There is strong evidence that physical activity is important in the general public at risk for developing heart disease. In the current analysis of the current evidence it was not clear if physical activity or physical exercise was more important in reducing heart disease risk, however, there was a significant effect of physical activity upon CVD risk.\nThere is also concern that the benefits of health intervention appear to be dependent on the severity of CVD for the individuals participating in the intervention program. For example, it is not clear whether the benefits of high intensity exercise are more important for individuals with worse chronic disease rather than more mild CVD than better chronic disease. Therefore, this risk has often come in at a late stage in the intervention programme.\nTo date, no information has been published of the specific effects of physical activity on people with CVD. There is also conflicting evidence as to whether the benefits are sustained after the intervention program.\nThe current evidence for the benefits of exercise for people with CVD is somewhat conflicting at present. Although several observational studies suggest that exercise is beneficial for individuals with CVD, little is known about the benefits of physical exercise for individuals without CVD. This is because there are few epidemiological studies which follow subjects for long enough to determine whether exercise is beneficial in people with CVD.\nThere is some evidence of the benefits of low to moderate intensity physical activity for individuals with CVD, but this evidence of benefit needs to be examined more closely. This could have major implications for CVD prevention. These include an improvement in clinical outcomes (with potential benefits in CVD management and patient outcomes such as quality of life, smoking cessation and the effects of the treatment), as well as positive economic implications as exercise has been shown to help with weight loss, blood pressure control and the management of other conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.\nPhysical activity guidelines for CVD should therefore provide individuals with CVD with the opportunity to exercise in the context of high to moderate intensity or at a low intensity of exercise, and to maintain the recommended levels of activity and duration and intensity of exercise in a programme which addresses health risk factors.\nThis strategy would help individuals and families at increased risk for CVD and their families to reduce the risk.\nThe", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\nA) Lifestyle modification\nB) Low-fat diet\nC) Medication of statin\nD) No intervention\nSource: The Royal College of General Practitioners\nThe bottom line is that it seems unlikely that a man of all ages would have to make such an effort to significantly reduce his risks in order to maintain a healthy heart for himself.\nThis is where lifestyle modification comes in. As a general guide, it\u2019s always recommended that adults have at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week, that you get up and move a little every day.\nFor instance, if you have a 5-minute walk at lunch, you might get up a foot length and move around for a few minutes. In case 150 minutes doesn\u2019t fit your schedule, don\u2019t believe me? You can have a 45-minute workout 3 times per week and that really doesn\u2019t go past a 30 minute walk that can be done in your car and in your day\u2019s routine.\nYou could have a 25-minute walk once a day, or even a 10-minute walk in the yard 3 to 4 times a week.\nSo what\u2019s the bottom line?

(Answer will be provided.) The current state of affairs on CHD prevention in the Western World has a tendency to be more restrictive than it should be. It is not surprising that some 81% of these patients, including John, are likely to die. What does it mean to prevent people from dying? The current recommendations suggest the following: 1. Implement and promote diet and exercise. 2. Prevent smoking. 3. Avoid diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer, and other cardiovascular diseases. 4. Minimize alcohol consumption. 5. Reduce the use of tobacco. 6. Consider screening for hypertension. 7. Prevent any chronic diseases associated with an unhealthy lifestyle, such as cancer and heart disease. 8. Recognize and prevent any form of psychosocial problems causing poor health.\nThe main goal when developing these recommendations was to limit the number of cases of heart disease and stroke among the public. There is no specific number of people who need prevention. What other recommendations are you recommending for your patients?

Rather, there were indications that, \u201cif any, we\u2019ll be recommending a cigarette in the presence of a history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes or dyslipidemia\u201d. The recommendation then being \u201ckeep it as low as possible without limiting one\u2019s choice of smoking drugs\u201d.\nThe Lancet Commission on Chronic Cardiovascular Disease\nrecommends a \u201cmoderate level\u201d of tobacco and alcohol consumption: 14 units for both and 140mg/kg/day for both. It acknowledges the harms of nicotine overdose as well as the risks of chronic inflammation, smoking-related coronary disease, and chronic obstructive lung disease. \u201cGiven the role of the brain in the control of appetite and the fact that people with hypertension tend to be unable to control their appetite, the increased risk for coronary heart disease,\u201d says the Commission chairman, Professor Jonathan Bate.\nThe Commission recommends that the National Health Insurance Scheme and various government public health policies will cover nicotine-replacement therapies, so that smokers can cut down their contribution to cardiovascular disease. However, the Commission\u2019s recommendations will not stop smokers from smoking, say some commentators.\nWhat about the guidelines themselves? There are 11 main recommendations, all of which focus on increasing social and environmental inequalities between groups. The recommendations that have received the most publicity are on \u201csocial protection\u201d, and they are the one that has received the most calls for reform. The Commission estimates that just 1.6% of the population has access to a minimum of \u00a340 per week. That\u2019s a little under \u00a311,000 per year for 40% of adults. It is far less than the \u00a3500 per week that is the benchmark for social equality.\nAs for smoking cessation, the Commission recommends that any interventions that target smoking cessation \u2013 including those that include nicotine replacement therapies \u2013 should consider the following points: \u201cthat this includes tobacco, but also other drug options, such as nicotine patches and nicotine gum, alcohol replacement therapy, medication, counselling and telephone assistance.\u201d They also recommend that smokers should consider what kind of support they need. This could include education about the harms of smoking, or support groups and other means of support, including tobacco-free communities.\nAnother recommendation is that there should be a review of interventions designed to improve food choices and diets, and it was argued that the existing health service has limited the role of social care services in this area. This is why the Commission recommends that all government-owned social services should provide \u201csocial services\u201d on the condition that they have \u201cintegrated nutrition and food security to deliver the best quality of life in terms of physical, emotional and social well-being\u201d. They also recommend that the current NHS programme be expanded to include an integrated nutrition service.\nThe Commission calls for comprehensive action to tackle social inequality, not just by targeting the burden of disease on a given group, but to take a broader approach. One argument for this includes addressing inequalities between groups: \u201cbecause of the fact that some groups are being pushed into lower social status because they smoke rather than because of high levels of poverty, what kind of inequalities is that?\u201d it concludes. It also calls for greater awareness that, \u201cthe impact of tobacco and alcohol abuse on people\u2019s physical and mental health cannot be understated both for the health of their physical bodies and the state of their social functioning\u201d.\nWhat are some areas in which the Commission is advocating for reform? There are some key areas of reform that it proposes to pursue \u2013 for example, reducing the number of smokers and people with type 2 diabetes \u2013 which would, it says, \u201cnot only improve the social conditions, but could also potentially reduce the burden from stroke, dementia and heart attack and potentially improve the lives of people living with chronic co-morbidities. The Government should consider these, as well as further initiatives to ensure that tobacco-based products and alcohol are not sold in supermarkets, pharmacies and mobile shops, where they are thought to be least effective. This would also involve a better way around the problem of nicotine deficiency in some ethnic minority groups\u201d.\nThere are also some important reforms in legislation that are needed, such as: the 2010 cigarette tax revision and the requirement to collect taxation data by income level to identify the risk-sensitive groups \u2013 such as the poor, the elderly and disadvantaged groups. There is also an obligation on manufacturers and", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\na. 1 x 1017\nb. 1 x 1021\nc. 1 x 10\u00d710-7\nd. 1 x 1016\n2.What is the correct time interval for blood glucose in a 2-hour insulin test?\na.

For many factors, the overall population at higher risk, including those who are older, have more than one of the following: high blood pressure, smoking, obesity, excess body fat, or high blood cholesterol, or who have a family history of CVD, those with a history of diabetes, or those with diabetes mellitus.\n- The 2019 WHO Lifestyle Change Recommendation for Older People for Adults in Low-and Middle-Income Countries, was revised.The aim was to promote a more sustainable lifestyle for older people - specifically, reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the current population.\n- The updated guidelines were based on a review of the scientific evidence and the impact of lifestyle interventions on CVD risk in all regions of the world.\n- The guidelines recommend strategies such as lifestyle changes, such as modifying smoking or physical activity, as well as lifestyle modification interventions for specific risk factors, focusing on physical activity, dietary changes, and weight loss.", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?

The recommendation from the NHS guidelines, for the UK-wide majority of adults, includes reducing saturated fat to 10% of total fat intake and to 20% overall fat intake.\nNot only is this eating has very little of the nutrients that are good for keeping your heart in good shape, it has very few of the nutrients that provide health benefits. Also, this low-fat diet is a low-sugar diet. Sugar, including fructose and simple carbohydrates (corn syrup), is the leading cause of heart disease in the UK. Reducing added sugar by 95% is recommended in UK guidelines from the UK Heart Foundation, to save money.\nHowever, in a nutshell:\n- The UK Heart Foundation\u2019s heart-friendly dietary advice includes reducing saturated fat to 10% of total fat intake and improving overall dietary fibre intake by at least 50%\n- This means reducing the average total saturated fat intake of 20% of total fat intake from 10% to 10%\n- This means reducing the average total saturated fat intake of 20% of total fat intake from 10% to 10%\n- Reducing the average total cholesterol intake of 50% of total cholesterol intake from 20% to 30%\n- Reducing the average total HDL (good) cholesterol intake of 20% of total HDL intake from 15% to 10%\nOf course, this is not perfect.

Of course there were all the other diets they followed, but these have not had the same influence on their health. If John were to follow a low-fat diet, he would have a poor heart and a poor cholesterol profile.\nSo he, and his partner, are now in a much healthier state. This is their NHS heart-healthy report.\nWhat is the NHS Heart Diet?\nThe NHS Heart Diet is the current dietary advice from the NHS for healthy heart disease in UK-wide adults and low-fat diets for people at risk of heart disease who smoke or are pregnant, or have diabetes, heart failure or heart attack, stroke, or have kidney problems.\nIt is based on research that shows the effect of dietary changes, compared with diet currently in use in the country, can dramatically improve the long-term health of UK men and women over their lifespan, regardless of their health risk.\nThe NHS Heart Diet provides recommendations by age and health status for healthy heart-protective diets, based on the following six general categories of diet:\n- Limit saturated fat. The aim of this diet is to cut the saturated fat in the UK diet.\n- The main reduction recommended in the diet is in total saturated fat.\n- The general advice for this diet is to cut all total saturated fat, along with other major sources of cholesterol, such as saturated and trans fat.\nThis Diet is based on many factors that are taken into account when looking at heart health", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?

We hope that the forum will help bring these discussion points to focus in the same way we\u2019ve helped people before.\nWhat are the recommendations for controlling CVD risk?\nFirst of all, it\u2019s important to know how to measure the risk. A simple way to determine the possibility that he has heart disease is by checking his systolic blood pressure. Since we know this a number, we\u2019d ask the help of the member with high-risk. Next, we\u2019d ask the help of the member with low-risk. The member with high-risk must have two things. They must be women, and they need to have a family history of CVD before making a decision to have children and have children. These two risk factors together should be tested. At that point, you can ask him to take the Framingham Scale. The Framingham Scale measures how easily a person is able to increase their HDL cholesterol and lower their LDL cholesterol. A high risk has a low HDL level for 114/61 mmHg, a normal level for 114/61 mmHg, and a normal value for more than 90% of the time. Then we\u2019d ask him how well he feels and how do you know this. He\u2019s trying harder when he feels better. Now if the member wants to get to the heart of the point that he\u2019s interested in discussing with us, we\u2019d ask them to talk about what would happen if the person\u2019s cholesterol went down from 114/61 mmHg to 96/100 mmHg or higher. The member would ask about what might happen if the person raised his HDL level back up to a higher level for another ten years. He\u2019d ask if he thinks this is possible for those people who\u2019d be in his lifestyle, so that we can see if there were symptoms of CVD, or if there are symptoms, or there are lifestyle changes we can make to reduce or eliminate them. This is also a very subjective topic because you have to go back and take the time to talk to the person, and we\u2019d be able to make specific suggestions in order to get the message across.\nThere are some other points too. These include the need for regular exercise, and smoking cigarettes, not drinking alcohol, and trying to have more vegetables in their plate and nuts in their heart meal plans. If this is the case, we would ask these types of questions through theforum.\nHow can we support the person at risk? And how can we get them in touch with other healthcare professionals who can support him?\nWe will definitely have discussion on other areas of this issue in the future. Let\u2019s start with another important issue. Is he taking his CVD risk level into account in his prescription or treatment decisions? This is something that we can\u2019t always control. But we can try to be as sensitive as we can on this for example. We want to make sure he gets this information to be clear and simple, and if he can\u2019t go to the doctor, we can ask for help. There is another area where our work can be helpful - to find out if there\u2019s any reason for him to be tested for a genetic disorder. There\u2019s a genetic disorder called FRAXA I and this disease occurs as a result of a genetic disorder of a person\u2019s father. It\u2019s a rare genetic disorder at present.

However, to ensure the health-promoting effects of these behaviours, the recommendations for risk of CVD are 1st degree family history, history of CVD, CVD history or risk, and a recent personal history of CVD. For individuals with a BMI of 30 or more kg/m2, the guidelines include a reduction of 10% of total cholesterol to 70 mmol/L in the first year or more, a reduction of 50% of HDL-cholesterol to 50 mmol/L; 100% of LDL-cholesterol to 1.0 mmol/L for the second year or more, 10% of VLDL-cholesterol and 50% of HDL-cholesterol to 5.5 mmol/L for the third year or more and 10% of LDL-cholesterol and 50% of HDL-cholesterol to 5.5 mmol/L in the first year or more, and 100% of LDL-cholesterol to >25.0 mmol/L for the following age or beyond.\nAge 70 or more:\nAge 25 to 49:\nAge over 65:\nAny chronic disease at risk for CVD, including diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and hypercholesterolemia:\nChronic use of tobacco:\nChronic use of alcohol:\nFamily history of CVD:\nRisk of CVD among individuals at relatively high risk for CVD (10% of the population) should be reduced to a minimum of 50%. The recommendations for individuals without CVD risk, however, differ from those for individuals with CVD risk in terms of risk factors. Some estimates of CVD risk for adults with COPD who don\u2019t smoke, for example, are 30-50% and 80 to 200% higher for people with elevated triglyceride, low HDL-cholesterol, tobacco use, and diabetes. For people without comorbidities (such as smokers, people with CVD), the risks vary significantly between the highest and the lowest risk levels. Even those with elevated HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol can expect to reduce at least 10% of their total cholesterol by quitting smoking and increasing physical activity on a regular basis.\nThose at the highest risk of CVD should be encouraged to assess their lifestyle habits and consider the effects of their lifestyle on CVD. Most importantly, the recommendations are to prevent CVD, not treat it. The National Institute of Health and Science (NICE) recommends that healthy people follow a healthful and balanced diet to help them make positive changes in their lifestyle. To learn about the impact of diet on the risk of several lifestyle choices, consider the following:\n- The Mediterranean diet is a high-fat dietary pattern that promotes healthy cholesterol levels and good cardiovascular health.\n- The DASH diet is an eating pattern that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, low in saturated fat, with emphasis on potassium, sodium, and fiber.\n- A low-fat and high-fiber diet lowers cholesterol and blood pressure.\n- Eating a varied diet, such as fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and low-fat dairy products, provides essential nutrients for a healthy life.\nThese healthy eating patterns also make food choices more culturally appropriate and less stressful and make mealtime more enjoyable.\nThese dietary patterns are shown in Table 1.\n- Food Frequency Questionnaire\u2014May be used for people who do not know how to use a DASH eating pattern questionnaire.\n- A high-density lipoprotein is less stable and less likely to be oxidized, so it's important to decrease saturated fats, sugar, and salt. Low-density lipoprotein is linked with heart disease and stroke because HDL transports cholesterol from the liver to the cells of the heart. A healthy diet includes a variety of nutrient-rich foods\u2014i.e., fish, poultry, cereals, vegetables, fruit, milk, and yogurt\u2014as well as protein. This will include no more than 7 teaspoons (oz) of sugar.\n- Eat five weekly servings of fruits and vegetables. Eat foods made with whole grains and legumes, and eat no more than 4 teaspoons of added sugars.\n- Eat one serving of lean meat, fish, poultry, egg whites,", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\nWhat are the guidelines for CVD prevention for a non-smoker having a BMI of 27?\nTo what extent do I consider that the non-smoker can be considered a smoker?\nWhat are my options for risk assessment?\n|Non-smoker with elevated lipid, haemoglobin, BMI?|\n|A 70-year-old Indian woman with a BMI of 30, with a systolic blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg and no smoking, and no history of CVD, has lipid parameters which are normal.|\n|A male smoker whose smoking history is only with a 3-year long history of smoking tobacco has a heart rate of 65 and a blood pressure of 125/85 mm Hg and smoking history is only one year; his LDL cholesterol is not above 100.5 mg/dL and his HDL cholesterol is not above 4 mmol/l.

Given the above risks and the relatively recent increase in CVD mortality, it is unlikely that lifestyle control alone will prevent CVD in a generation, but such lifestyle modification might be an appropriate initial and preventive step.\n\u2022 According to the WHO, approximately 1 out of each 400 cases of CVD is fatal. If a number of people develop CVD over their lifetime \u2013 that 1 out of 20 of those will inevitably develop heart disease or stroke, assuming 20 years of lifetime CVD prevention \u2013 a number of potentially life-saving strokes and heart attacks could be prevented.\n\u2022 Approximately 1 out of every 5 people with coronary heart disease are younger than 55 years old. If you can have a life-threatening attack at 55, that would place an incredible number of people at risk throughout their life.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular disease develops over time, and the number of years to be affected varies between the 14.9 trillion to 55 trillion persons. People with a 20-percent risk for cardiovascular disease can live for 20-40 years, but people who have a 30-percent risk, typically live for 40-60 years. The most common cause of death in the United States is cardiovascular disease.\nWhat are some practical or clinical applications of cardiovascular risk reduction strategies?\n\u2022 The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that doctors be careful to exclude patients who have signs and symptoms of cardiovascular disease or who are at elevated risk of cardiovascular disease; these are people who may be asymptomatic and have less risk factors.\n\u2022 Current risk stratification studies have a range of values for age and sex, but this is often insufficient to consider different risk factors, e.g. genetics, age, sex, history of smoking and physical activity.\n\u2022 We suggest that clinicians consider the following factors.\n\u2022 If any of these factors is known to be present, it is assumed that it is more important for clinicians to think long-term about reducing risk than about simple reduction in age or sex alone.\n\u2022 If the risk factors have fallen by just 50 percent, it is assumed that the risk will decrease further to less than 50 percent by at age 80. But if the risk continues to decline, then it is assumed that it will plateau by 0 to 20 years of age. If the risk continues to decline further to 100% it is assumed will decline further and continue to decline.\n\u2022 If there is increased risk for more than 50 years of age, it is assumed that it will continue to increase. If there is increased risk for less than 50 years, it is assumed to continue to decrease.\n\u2022 There may be other potential risk factors that are more relevant or important over 80. For example, recent obesity is an increasing weight gain, and some risk factors associated with obesity are more predictive of a cardiovascular problem than others.\n\u2022 We suggest that clinicians consider the following concepts.\n\u2022 Over the next 10-20 years, we suggest that the number of people in America with a diagnosis of cardiac disease should be substantially decreased, particularly in older people.\n\u2022 The overall disease burden will be reduced and, if all aspects are addressed, it will be a great boon for society as a whole.\n\u2022 The estimated cost of reducing cardiovascular disease care in the United States is estimated at $28.8 billion per year, of which about 70 percent of the cost will be borne by society.\n\u2022 The cost of preventing heart disease will be $10.2 billion per year.\n\u2022 For every 100 smokers a man and 50 women in the study, there is an increased risk of stroke relative to those in a control group. This means that the health benefits from preventing heart disease far outweigh the economic and healthcare costs.\n\u2022 According to the World Health Organization, there are approximately 1 in 3 deaths worldwide could be prevented with this approach.\n\u2022 According to the WHO, more people are being diagnosed with heart disease every week worldwide. Some 1 out of every 4 smokers will have a heart attack \u2013 so it is likely that less than 30% of our adult smokers will die from heart disease.\n\u2022 Some studies suggest that 75-90% of cardiovascular disease is associated with obesity, but this is uncertain.

(200 words)\nIn this question, the questions were asked regarding (1) what is the most effective way to limit the risk for atherosclerosis (2) what is the most effective way to limit the risk for heart attacks (3) what is the most effective way to prevent CVDs (4) what is the most effective way to prevent cancer (5) what is the best way to prevent heart failure (6) what is the best way to prevent stroke (7) what is the best way to prevent cancer and death from cancer/heart disease (8) what is the best way to prevent cancer and death from CVD. The questions were asked in several different questions. The word \u201cbest\u201d was not given and was used in paragraph 1. It can be found after paragraph 2, paragraph 4, paragraph 7, paragraph 11, paragraph 26, paragraph 37, paragraph 44, paragraph 47, paragraph 58, paragraph 78, paragraph 85, paragraph 145, paragraph 175, paragraph 17, paragraph 18, paragraph 18a, paragraph 18b, paragraph 19b, paragraph 20, paragraph 20, paragraph 21, paragraph 27, paragraph 28, paragraph 33, paragraph 34, paragraph 37, paragraph 42, paragraph 59, paragraph 61, paragraph 71, paragraph 84, paragraph 9, paragraph 11.\nYour task is to answer the questions as quickly as possible and to provide an explanation of your answer in your own words.\nI feel that the answer should be on paragraph 72 which states that in order to get an absolute risk reduction, \u201cindividuals should be encouraged to make a lifestyle-related modification in diet as quickly as possible over the long term. \u201cI see two reasons why this might be so. Firstly, for example, the health-care system may be failing in its role of prevention, even when looking at early-detection-and-prevention-programs to prevent a heart attack. The question suggests that the \u201cideal\u201d lifestyle would include making sure people are eating healthy, exercising often and not smoking (10 points), but that people are already doing a great job when it comes to \u201cactual\u201d prevention. Additionally, the question asks us to take the time to look at the evidence. If we were talking about \u201caverage\u201d, I would say that the \u201cideal\u201d lifestyle (a lifestyle that could be ideal for the average person), was not very good. In those cases, the evidence shows us we need to do more to be healthy, something that the current health-care system has an awful reputation as not being designed to tackle a whole range of issues, and even some good ideas. And because there was already a \u201cideal\u201d lifestyle, and because most people have some form of disease, this means that there are so many bad interventions that it is likely that the public is unlikely to change their diet and exercise habits to improve risk for disease. It is still the \u201cideal\u201d approach to risk reduction when the population is healthy, which is what is being done.\nThe other part of the question that seems to require more background information and explanation is paragraph 19, which states that the most important factor for disease-crisis prevention is avoiding harmful lifestyle habits (15 points). I feel that the answer should be on paragraph 10 which \u201cIt is clear that lifestyle changes have an important role in preventing the development of CVD, cancer, stroke and dying from a disease.\u201d\nIf the answer to the question is \u201cIt is clear that lifestyle changes have an important role in preventing the development of CVD, and preventing and dying from a disease\u201d, then it is safe to say people have already taken some of the measures we have addressed on this question.\nHowever, if the answer to the question is \u201cIt is clear that lifestyle changes have an important role in preventing the development of CVD, and preventing and dying from a disease\u201d, then further information is needed on the risks for CVD prevention. So, the answer is \u201cIt is clear that lifestyle changes have an important role in preventing the development of CVD and the prevention and dying from a disease.\u201d The risk reduction advice should be \u201cSmoking cessation\u201d.\nI feel that the answer to the question is \u201cSmoking cessation\u201d. However, smoking cessation has been shown to be the best way to help prevent diseases as you can stop smoking and your risk", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\nA: There are three major guidelines for CVD prevention: (1) diet and physical activity together; (2) no lifestyle risk factors; (3) a combination of smoking, diabetes and high blood pressure. Of all five guidelines, one is the most important because: (1) it is the most appropriate one for all communities, (2) health professionals should be prescribing these guidelines, (3) it has the most impact and (4) has already been implemented and endorsed by the UK government. It applies to both smokers and non-smokers and it includes a diet guideline for overweight adults and it includes a plan to prevent the onset and progression of CVD in all men between the ages of 25-75.\nThe diet guidelines for overweight adults also apply to non-smokers due to the prevalence of CVD among smokers who do not smoke or in smokers who are not at risk.\nThe recommended dose of exercise for adults and individuals is 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week, equivalent to about 30 min at a moderate pace; 20\u201330 minutes of vigorous exercise, equivalent to a 150- to 300-meter brisk walk; and a small amount of muscle strengthening exercise, as indicated by the UK Guide to Physical Activity for Health and Wellbeing.\nThe advice in diabetes management for children aged 12-19 years:\nWhen talking about how to manage diabetes in children, it\u2019s best to take a \u201cwhole-of-life\u201d approach to health so that everyone matters. A good start is to start with basic health promotion work, including a 4D model, and then gradually build on the health behaviours and skills that have been identified for children aged 3\u201319 in the National Diabetes Education Programme (NDEP). The NDEP Health Behaviour in Policing Model: Behaviour, Practice and Policy for Diabetes (HBpD), also offers a range of examples that can help parents, teachers and practitioners identify best practice, to encourage children to take personal responsibility for taking practical steps to maintain their health (CeM.gov.uk, 2021).\nDISCLAIMER: Medical and/or Health Professional Advisor\u2019s Opinions about any subject matter are always available through one of the platforms mentioned above.\nGustavo\u2019s diet regimen is one that involves limiting fat intake while increasing your carbohydrate intake to stay as healthy as possible.

Yet it is clear to the people with chronic conditions that a healthy diet is essential, she says.\nSo much more needs to be done!\nAs the 2018 NICE guideline states:\nThe advice of NICE is based on sound scientific evidence, with guidance on how to provide care in accordance with national guidelines and appropriate social and practical advice.\nIt does not necessarily recommend or encourage \u2018anything done within a general framework as the basis for a healthy diet.\u2019 Health professionals and the public should always be aware of the possible risks.\nIt is very important to remember that if we eat too much of a bad food, we will eat more of a food that we need, and if we do this, we will gain weight.\nDiet can have an enormous impact on weight.\nDiet should only be part of a health-promoting lifestyle and you as the individual need always be aware of the possible risks of eating too much of a bad food, and that if we eat too much of a bad diet, it will result in weight gain.\nThe advice of NICE is based on sound scientific evidence, with guidance on how to provide care in accordance with national guidelines and appropriate social and practical advice.\nPlease email your questions to", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\nCardio (Cardiovascular) is \u201ca group of conditions involving the heart and the blood vessels, the heart and blood vessels, the circulatory, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and reproductive systems.\u201d A number of factors can affect your risk of developing cardiovascular health, including smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high levels of protein in your urine, obesity, physical inactivity, and others.\nWhat is the most prominent risk factor (in our sample) for an individual who is at risk of developing CVD?\nAccording to the \u201cNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 5) 2011-2012,\u201d \u201cphysical inactivity was the greatest risk factor for heart disease.\u201d People who were not physically active had a greater chance of dying early than exercising more regularly (7.7 versus 3.1 deaths per 100,000 person-years, P =.001).\nHowever, smoking is associated with an increased risk of heart disease due to a number of potentially modifiable factors. When these factors are taken together, the potential for a high risk of heart disease is increased. This is an unfortunate reality for many people: it means that their risk of early death is greater than in people who are not exposed to such factors. To overcome this, we recommend that people should discuss their risk of dying with a physician who is knowledgeable about CVD prevention.\nHow would you describe the importance of having a healthy lifestyle? What are the key elements of a healthy lifestyle?\nHealth is associated with the life span (the length of a person\u2019s life) and of the body or organ systems (your body). In the same article, we noted that for young adults, \u201chealthy choices affect how your body works to its maximum.\u201d For example, there is evidence that people with diabetes benefit from controlling their blood pressure and cholesterol.\nHealthy diet, which we recommend your nutritionist will help create, is an important part of good health. That sounds good, even though you may wonder what you are eating and doing. Eating a healthy diet not only affects the quality of your nutrition, but it also influences your health and well-being.\nThis is especially true in terms of the nutrients in your food. In a typical Western diet (a diet dominated by processed foods, fast food, refined, ultra-processed foods, and sugar, as well as alcohol), our diets are largely high in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, sodium (salt), sugars, and calories, which are all detrimental to our health. These nutrients are often not easily taken from nature (which is why we recommend you eat more fruits and vegetables), but may easily be included in a diet high in processed foods and sugar. The foods in your diet can also contain some antioxidants and vitamins. Antioxidants are compounds that protect us from damage from oxidative stress by free radicals in the body. Antioxidants are a good part of a healthy diet, but you should be sure to ensure that the foods you choose are of highest quality.\nHave you always considered the cardiovascular system part of your health?

Diabetes mellitus is mostly an acquired condition and only one type of the disease, type 2 diabetes, has no known cure; therefore, what three common diseases are caused by the disease?\nBe the first to have a go to the nearest Indian Institute of Science.", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\nJohn had a history of a history of myocardial infarction in 2012, he was diagnosed with diabetes in 2009 and he suffered a heart attack in 2013. His history of CVD is based on his current diagnosis of coronary artery disease as the patient is an adult (mean age of 72y), his total cholesterol is 4.0mmol/L, her HDL cholesterol is 4.3 mmol/L and her blood pressure is 114/61 mmHg.\nJohn is classified as having CVD (cardiovascular disease) according to his current diagnosis, he did not have a heart attack until 2013, his diagnosis of CVD is based on his current history of coronary artery disease that was diagnosed 20 years ago and he was treated for a heart attack at the age of 55. He is an active patient who reports that his CVD symptoms are improved with medication and other treatments for his CHD as his new diagnosis. Because his CVD did not change by 2013, it was assumed that John had not been diagnosed with CVD in 2012 and he remains non-clogged in his CV until now. Our CHD screening is based on a history of CVD but it is also based on our current clinical assessment that John has the same degree of functional impairment as John who is a non-clogged. If John were to be diagnosed with CVD it would mean that he would need several more annual assessments, however because he came into the lab with no symptoms and is not a candidate for a physical examination, he would only need a single assessment.\nOur clinical assessment should include the following:\n- A comprehensive cardiovascular history which will include the history of your own cardiovascular system to identify risk factors for CVD in your particular case.\n- A fasting lipid profile including the HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and a fasting insulin profile.\n- A pulse wave Doppler assessment where if there is evidence of reduced blood flow to the coronary arteries there is a large reduction in the left heart flow to the subclavian veins and the small anterior branches of the carotid arteries. The detection of this is based on the fact that if these arteries are narrow one could have a large left ventricle and an acute injury if that is present. The detection is based on the fact that if arteries that have narrow and enlarged than normal also have poor collateral circulation. With the introduction of CHD screening in your patients the objective of your clinical assessment should include screening for the presence of narrow arteries and collateral circulation, which is key to identifying non-clogged CHD. You should be able to do this from a chest x-ray and your patient may need a coronary angiography, although this exam would take time and will need to be completed as part of a general assessment.\n- An electrocardiogram including the diagnosis of ventricular dysinvolvement and ventricular function.\n- A carotid ultrasound which could be useful in identifying any coarsely distensible and narrow atherosclerotic lesions to the carotid arteries that can be seen on an electrocardiogram.\n- A cardiac test with pulse doppler and ultrasound, so that any evidence of increased pressure in the coronary artery can be detected.\n- An echocardiogram is useful to monitor left ventricular function as well as any signs of abnormal blood flow in the heart.\nJohn could be classed as a high risk of CVD or non-clogged CVD as there are no evidence that the CVD symptoms could be improved by further anti-clotting medications or angioplasty. At this stage John will be assessed on the diagnosis of CVD using the NICE guidance guidelines and as part of this John is advised to see his GP.\nThe evaluation for John will not necessarily begin until the evaluation for the patient as part of the overall CHD screening, but John will be asked to do an EKG and the EKG will be recorded. In addition, John will be offered an HbA1c blood test which measures the average HbA1c over 35 days. The screening has been described as one of the most difficult aspects of the screening. However with the improvement of ECG scanning technology and advances in ECG analysis, this test can be performed more quickly, for example within 30 minutes, however the majority of ECG studies used the 11-day repeat, which means that John will perform several more at 30 days rather than more than 3 weeks each time.\nJohn will then receive follow-up assessments to the following:\n- A", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\nA cardiovascular assessment may provide important information to determine the need for medication such as statins, or to target the individual's cardiovascular risks.\nIn John's case, he had been screened for heart disease at age 55. He is no longer suffering from a cardiovascular problem since his initial screening visit was at age 35.\nHe has been regularly screened under the watchful eye of the NHS, and no specific cardiovascular or cholesterol problems have been detected. However, there are reasons to be concerned. John's first cardiac screening with the NHS was at age 70.\nJohn's family decided the blood tests showed that his cholesterol was high and he was on medication to lower it and to lower his blood pressure.\nIn addition, he has had his blood pressure medication for eight years and he has also been known to smoke 50 cigarettes a day. He now has diabetes, has atrial fibrillation, and has a history of poor cardiovascular health.\nJohn was put into an inpatient hospital ward that has recently been converted into a rehab centre for people with heart disease. He has been admitted and has been monitored continuously, although his heart has failed and there are no other symptoms to see.\nAs a result of John's recent experience, including the cardiac monitoring and blood pressure monitoring, the NHS gave him three more hospital admissions that last year.\nAt the time of his hospital admission, John was in the hospital admissions at age 70. His blood pressure was 114/61 mmHg and his cholesterol was normal. He has already been on a dose of statins for the past two years.\nJohn's diagnosis may help reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular problems in the years to come. At the time of John's medical examination, his total cholesterol was 114, and blood pressure was normal. A heart score 162 and an EKGs score 167 were taken.\nThe initial screening of John's ECG results was successful. His total cholesterol was reduced to 116, and his blood pressure was down to 77/43 mmHg. This has improved slightly, and the EKGs and total cholesterol have been reduced further. John's EKGs are still less than double their normal, which is 36 for healthy people. A heart score of 162 and an EKGs score of 167 are necessary.\nA number of factors may have taken place during his treatment that may have increased the risk of developing the particular condition. They include:\n|Drug||Dose of statin||Blood cholesterol level||Breath tests|\n|Pacemaker||1st 14 weeks||121 mm Hg||Low or lower LDL cholesterol||140-mg creatine hydrochloride|\n|Blood pressure||Systolic: 120 mm Hg||Diastolic: 80 mm Hg||High||400 mg dLctl-2,5,8|\n|Heart test||LDL-cholesterol: 80 mg||HDL-cholesterol: 60 mg||Negative||55 mg-373 mg of dalton-2,5,8|\n|Cardiac scan||Systolic: 122 mm Hg||Diastolic: 82 mm Hg||Expected to have heart damage: 50-69 mg||20+0||6|\nJohn's case was managed with the help of the NHS and his family to monitor his cardiac status. John's heart attack is under control and he is able to get back to work, having spent three months off.\nIf John had been treated for heart disease and was now considered to be at high risk, the NHS could change the age for screening in John's case.\nIt is important that John's cardiac examination shows that the risk of developing cardiovascular problems is low. However, there is a good chance that his risk of developing any of these conditions will increase if he is monitored over time.\nJohn is now being aggressively monitored by a heart specialist and his family have been informed that he is no longer at risk of developing cardiovascular problems.\nJohn's annual 6-monthly lipid profile showed values of 2.141, while his daily cholesterol levels were 198.\nOver a year, John's cholesterol levels dropped to 198. His triglyceride levels were also decreased to 226. This has not been increased, so there are no changes in his", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\nYour answer should indicate the following:\nJohn has a BMI of 30, a blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, a history of smoking, a recent history of cardiovascular disease, at a recent diagnosis of hyperlipidemia (cholesterol), a family history of cardiovascular disease and a current smoker.", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\nJohn\u2019s physician would probably recommend screening for diabetes and hypertension early, but there are 2 reasons for why cardiovascular screening is most likely not being done. The first reason is that he doesn\u2019t like to exercise. On one hand, it\u2019s fine for him to be active, to work out and be physically fit, but on the other hand, he can\u2019t exercise because he has a high resting blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg and does not exercise much.\nThe second reason is that although our heart is more efficient than it used to be, it\u2019s about as efficient as your skin is. On this basis, a lower than average total cholesterol level is a bad thing and has a higher risk of heart attack and stroke.\nIn contrast, a \u201cnormal\u201d LDL result has a protective effect that the same 25-year-old John\u2019s HDL level could be as protective as taking cholesterol-lowering medication, even if he doesn\u2019t exercise enough. To put it plainer, the doctor would probably only recommend a \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol test as you move onto the next item, which would take 8 years to go through the screening. Even if John is at risk for heart attack or stroke, a \u201cgreat\u201d or \u201cvery high\u201d HDL level still has strong protective effects, which makes the \u201cgood\u201d version of the cholesterol-testing much safer than the low, medium, and high/very high options, respectively.\nWhat makes John\u2019s situation so severe? Why is that important? Well, it\u2019s because the risks for heart attacks and stroke increase for all forms of heart disease more rapidly than they do for heart attacks. The major risk factors for most forms of heart disease are being over 50 years old, a history of diabetes, and a history of smoking.\nWhen a heart attack goes untreated, the longer it goes untreated, the more damage is caused. Thus, if John is in his 70s, an attack can go far too long without getting better, and there is an increased risk of death. If John has diabetes, his risk for heart attack and stroke is 3 times as high in diabetics, with heart attack rates 3.7 times higher.\nOne way that heart disease may be prevented is simply to exercise more. A study suggested exercising to a healthy heart puts your risk of death at about 19 times higher than it is without exercising. Although there are no hard and fast rules for how much exercise John should be doing, there is enough scientific research to tell you that moderate exercise (15 to 30 minutes per day) is the best diet and workout plan for heart disease.\nFinally, the third reason is that John\u2019s symptoms must be taken seriously. His symptoms include breathlessness, chest pain, chest pressure, pain in the abdomen, weight gain and difficulty swallowing. They all begin with mild symptoms of a temporary illness, such as a cold or flu. It\u2019s important to seek timely and professional help because there are no quick fixes or solutions available for heart problems.\nThe Heart is the \u201cEngine\u201d\nThe heart is the \u201cengine\u201d that pumps blood through your system. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), a person with a normal total cholesterol level has a higher risk for many heart attacks and strokes.\nThe AHA recommends you keep your cholesterol levels under 130 mg/dL and blood pressure below 120/80. However, it is better to have your cholesterol and blood pressure checked on a regular basis depending on your risk factors, and it is possible to get too high and not have side effects.\nWhen it comes to lifestyle choices, it is important to be mindful and not to jump to conclusions when doctors are evaluating your treatment. John\u2019s physician would probably suggest that he get his cholesterol and blood pressure tested within the first few months of starting a new medication regimen. If he has a risk factor for heart disease, like tobacco use or diabetes, he should continue to get treated. If he gets a low blood pressure reading, he should be monitored for the next several days, and if it is on the positive side, he should continue the treatment that has been made positive by his first check-up.\nIf a low blood pressure reading is made positive by the second check-up, then you may need to have your blood pressure corrected and your A1C reported.\nJohn\u2019s doctor would probably advise him to have his blood pressure tested in the first six months of starting a new medication regimen, and", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\n2.

Make a comprehensive history and complete a physical exam.\n2. Provide accurate screening mammograms and CTs.\n3. Continue regular follow-ups to evaluate breast health, monitor changes over time and assess for recurrence of cancer.\n4. Ensure regular follow-ups for cancers of the oral cavity, larynx (throat), esophagus and pancreas.\n5. Perform breast ultrasound, breast MRI and MRI-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the breast tissue for early detection of cancer. Consider screening for the following: early-stage breast cancer, breast cancer subtypes, and suspicious lymph nodes (not necessarily cancer).\n6. Perform breast self-examination to check for breast lumps and any of the following: a. Breast mass: If you find a new lump, have it examined or your doctor can confirm breast cancer with a biopsy.\n7. Practice self-breast examinations.\n8. Perform regular dental examinations and dental sealant testing.\n9. Consider mammograms if you are at high risk for breast cancer.\nIt is important to note that the diagnosis of breast cancer is complex and can be influenced by a variety of factors.\nSome factors in which breast cancer can be detected more effectively include a thorough medical history, a history of the breast as a member of the family, and a physical exam in a regular and frequent frequency. It is important to report any changes in the appearance of the breast and check for a lump in the breast.\nScreening mammograms is the first and most effective way to detect breast cancer early and increase the chances of recovery after cancer treatment. The American Cancer Society recommends that women ages 50 to 74 should have annual mammograms, and for women age 75 and up, after age 74.\nAlthough it may seem like the best choice, many women find that a mammogram is not enough. While a mammogram can save your life, several risks can come from this procedure.\nOne risk that some people experience is breast compression. This can reduce the quality of your mammogram. Another risk is an accident or accident. This could mean that you have not given your breast the right amount of care. But it does not necessarily mean that you have an accident that is no longer going to harm you, only that you have not followed the proper care during the mammogram.\nAnd you have a medical risk to not get these mammograms unless you want to risk a serious thing.\nAnother risk is the loss of brain. There has been a lot of research done with this. But what is not known is if we lose brain after the mammogram.\nIf this is the case, this process is not always effective in detecting cancer. This may come from the fact that there are no other imaging techniques when studying your breast.\nIt may make sense to have a mammogram in order to determine whether you are at a greater risk of breast cancer, the type of disease that may have occurred and how quickly it progresses. You know when you are a young baby and can see the first signs of a problem. So, you know what type of change you need to happen.\nBut, there can be an extra risk that you will have that problem that is not considered to be cancerous. So, you need to make sure that you perform the mammogram in order to determine whether it is the time that you want to have another mammogram.\nThere is no question that doing a mammogram in the early stage. It is important to have a mammogram in order to see whether you have cancer cells and to ensure that we will be able to detect changes later in the process.\nThere are also two main risk factors that must be present from the beginning. This is especially noticeable in women that are breast-conserving surgery and women that have received radiation. If the women received radiation, the level of risk increased.\nSome of women go on a daily day. That may bring up questions about the impact that taking this drug will have on them. And these women will probably do not pay attention to what their doctor is telling. They probably will not eat what is supposed to be in the form of diet because they may not want to eat a meal that will cause them to feel nauseous.\nUnfortunately, there are very few women who receive a diet that has been recommended. In addition, the advice of this decision may not cover most of the common food items.

(i) What medication can be added to control the medications and lifestyle alterations to improve outcomes and reduce CV disease progression (ii) What interventions are recommended to prevent future cardiovascular disease (iii) What lifestyle intervention options are recommended for the treatment of pre-CVD? [NICE guidelines]\nIn the literature, most research has focused on the diagnosis and management of CVD risk factors, primarily as a result of an individual-specific pathophysiology. We have therefore been trying to highlight the link between CVD risk factors and lifestyle modifications, especially in the context of physical activity, weight control, nutritional habits, and tobacco use.\nOur research has a number of objectives, which we outline below. (1) To highlight how lifestyle interventions (physical activity, exercise, weight control, nutritional habits, and smoking) influence people with a history of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease and their outcome if atherosclerosis or cardiovascular disease are present. (2) To highlight the link between lifestyle and vascular diseases that may underlie CVD progression and to highlight ways to prevent CVD progression.\nOur proposed project aims to identify modifiable factors that can predict CVD development or progression in young, healthy individuals: for example, physical inactivity alone is known to contribute to atherosclerosis and CVD, even in individuals without a history of CVD. Furthermore, we plan to assess the quality of a set of cardiovascular disease risk factors for individuals with a history of CVD and to identify how lifestyle changes may promote these risk factors but also may precipitate the development of cardiovascular disease.\nOur proposed research will:\n- Use quantitative and qualitative methodologies in partnership with physicians and healthcare workers.\n- Provide quantitative and qualitative clinical information (e.g., questionnaires and interviews) that can help physicians or healthcare workers understand the relationship between the lifestyle choice and cardiometabolic risk factors and CVD, and how these different lifestyle choices may contribute to the development or progression of cardiovascular disease (e.g., atherosclerosis) or to the prevention of CVD (e.g., atherosclerosis).\n- Review the epidemiology of the association between lifestyle factors and CVD risk and determine whether changes in lifestyle practice (e.g., exercise and physical activity) may partially underlie the association observed.\n- Evaluate the ability of these lifestyle practices to prevent or delay the development of CVD or reduce risk of CVD and the development of these cardiovascular diseases in young, healthy individuals using a novel cross-sectional analytical framework.\n- Explore the role of cardiovascular risk factors for young, healthy individuals over 18 years for which lifestyle habits may play a role in CVD progression or prevention, and how they may contribute to the development or progression of cardiovascular disease and how they may also play a role in the development of risk factors that may predispose a non-physiologic adult to CVD/CVD in their lifetime.\n- Assess the quality of the sample: a sample of 22 healthy volunteers over 18 years (age 18-40 years, mean age = 29.2 +/- 4.9 years) with at least a high school diploma, of normal weight and without history of CVD or heart disease.\n- Conduct an observational study of the health and lifestyle habits of the healthy volunteers in the study, including measurements of total energy expenditure and sleep quality, sleep duration, cardiovascular and respiratory parameters, physical activity, and smoking habits, as well as demographic data collected during the clinical visits.\n- Collect data relating personal characteristics (e.g., weight, height, BMI, gender, and smoking habits), and lifestyle habits of the healthy volunteers (e.g., sleep habits), to the health and lifestyle habits of health and the health and lifestyle habits of the healthy volunteers (i.e., dietary habits and exercise practices).\n- Examine the quality of the sample using a modified item measure of quality (ICD-S measure).\n- Perform a multivariate analysis to distinguish effects of physical activity, diet, smoking, lipids, and weight loss on the association between the variables used in the physical activity and diet and CVD risk factors in the population of interest; [Note: the physical activity and diet were chosen from the following sources: American Heart Association and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute dietary guidelines, the Japanese Cardiac and Vascular Society guidelines, and national surveys].\n- Test the hypothesis that physically active healthy volunteers have a reduced overall risk of CVD and atherosclerosis compared to other healthy volunteers.\n- Compare the relationships between these variables and CVD risk factors and how the variables may have different influences than those studied in other studies, to determine the optimal diet and exercise habits, while avoiding detrimental lifestyle practices.\n- Identify and compare lifestyle changes on heart health for young healthy volunteers", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\n100% agree with the NICE recommendation that lifestyle risk factor reduction be encouraged in individuals with obesity.

Archived http://www.heart.org/hypopress/heartaffect/heart/032110/26.pdf\n1202996724.pdf Heart Disease and Cardiovascular Surgery in Patients of African Descent: American Heart Association\nWhat is the ideal blood pressure for the lowest amount of time to give me a normal resting heart rate? The ideal blood pressure for the lowest amount of time to give me a normal resting heart rate? The American Heart Association (AHA) published its optimal blood pressure range which is set at 120-80 mmHg for restful resting heart rate. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that every adult should maintain the low end of the healthy range, namely the lowest of these standards: 110-85 mmHg in men and 100-75 mmHg in women. How can I reach the ideal heart rate and blood pressure? A healthy person that is an active 50 year old woman with a BMI of 28 and no heart disease can live to approximately age 100. However, heart disease should not be underestimated in the population of African descent with a normal BMI and a healthy blood pressure level at rest. The ideal resting heart rate is in the range of 60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm) and blood pressure of 110-80 mmHg or less at rest. If the heart rate is over 200 bpm, a doctor should be consulted. What are the risks of heart disease in patients with normal-weight African American and European-American males? The risks of heart disease in African American and European-American males differ from those of Asians if the heart disease risk factors are not taken into account. African American males have greater risk factors for heart disease (elevation of LDL cholesterol, high triglycerides) than Asian and European-American males. Women with heart disease risk factors (elevation of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, or high blood pressure) are also more vulnerable to heart disease. Women of Middle Eastern descent are less likely to have heart disease. A study conducted by the Cleveland Clinic compared the risk factors of heart disease in patients of non-African and Caucasian ancestry compared to African-American and African-Caribbean-American males. There was no significant difference in risk factor prevalence between African-American males and Caucasian males. It was concluded that, \u201cAfrican-American and Caucasian males have significantly different risk factors for heart disease, including prehypertension, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome, but are similar in terms of mortality.\u201d This means that African American males cannot possibly have heart disease and should therefore be treated in the same manner as non-African-American males. A study conducted by the American Heart Association with African-American males also concluded that risk factor prevalence is higher in males with higher levels of cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and vice versa. Both studies found that \u201cmen with elevated triglyceride and cholesterol levels had a 29% increased risk for a first cardiac event relative to men with high cholesterol.\u201d What does the blood test show for ACE inhibitors? There are many options for treating the condition of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) or reduced endothelial function. ACE inhibitors are the most widely used and approved option. Because of the high prevalence of PAD in people of African descent, the number of people taking this drug is increasing. Patients using oral blood pressure drugs should receive treatment with angiotensin receptor blockers to help prevent peripheral artery disease (PAD) and to improve the patient's blood pressure. What options exist for managing PAD? If one chooses to have surgery, angiotensin receptor blockers are the \u201cgold standard\u201d treatment. If one does not prefer surgery, the ACE inhibitors offer the greatest benefit. Patients can find an ACE inhibitor at the ADA's pharmacy, or at any physician\u2019s office. If a patient does need surgery, they may want to see a cardiologist for an alternative option such as transcatheter arterial balloon pump therapy", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD? Would treatment make a difference?\nThe decision to prescribe a drug to John was made after reviewing all aspects of the patient\u2019s medical history as well as his current risk profile. John had no heart disease at all but when asked about his smoking, his blood pressure reading showed it was 130/80. When asked about his blood pressure reading, he said it was 114 and his waist circumference showed it was 102 cm or over.\nThe NICE-led guidelines were also adapted from the World Health Organization\u2019s 2020 guidelines on cardiovascular risk screening and management and it confirmed that hypertension and dyslipidemia, elevated levels of blood cholesterol and systolic blood pressures are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.\nJohn started getting his BP checked in April so the 12th day of his annual visit to the GP was a success. John was advised to change into shorts, no long trousers, and to increase his intake of water and exercise.\nOne more question\nJohn\u2019s blood pressure reading was 134/92, and his cholesterol reading was in between 2 and 3.0 percent so he wasn\u2019t currently high risk.\n\u201cHowever, the 12th day was quite heartening to see that he was already improving. It does not happen that it doesn\u2019t happen at first but he is in the right frame of mind to have a discussion,\u201d says James, a GP at St John\u2019s with one of those patients.\n\u201cThat can be great as it will inform you of which things he can do to get his numbers back in the right range for the future. We are all in a position to talk to ourselves and find out where we are going. The important thing is that John is listening and taking an active part in getting him to make his numbers more healthy again.\u201d\nJohn started his exercise routine the next day and was asked to walk 1km a day three times a week. But as he walked around his walking area this month, he noticed what he called \u201closing a bit of his fitness.\u201d\n\u201cHe started out doing his running exercise a couple of months ago but now he likes to try longer walks instead,\u201d James says.\n\u201cHe always walks for around 2 hours at a time. He has to get up a bit and put it into a more strenuous form. This would be the most appropriate exercise for my patient but we discussed different ways of exercising with him that he might take better action on at home and will also reduce the risk of his getting into a heart disease situation. It would improve his health status overall and help him avoid a future heart disease case.\n\u201cI know he was in a lot of pain and I\u2019m always hopeful that something like this will help.\u201d\nThe NICE guidance\nThe NICE guideline for cardiovascular prevention for the prevention of ischemic cardiovascular disease (A) is now endorsed by the British Society of Cardiology as the 6th consensus statement. It is called the \u2018All Patients with Heart Disease should be screened for diabetes\u2019. This involves looking at the risk factors associated with coronary heart disease and is similar to the guidelines for CVD prevention of diabetes, so they share many of the same elements, but now focus on a different but slightly different aspect of risk factors:\n- Are all current smokers.\n- What has the person consumed in recent years?\n- Do symptoms of chest pain and/or shortness of breath have increased after a heart attack as a complication of the heart attack and if so, on top of the initial symptoms \u2013 shortness of breath\n- Have a family history of CVD\n- Are the patient currently using an ACE inhibitor medication?\nThis new guideline can be downloaded here or see the full-text here.\nThe decision of course\nThe NICE guidelines have been endorsed by the Joint Committee on Cholesterol and Blood Viscosity. It confirms that people who are at high risk for CVD, such as smoking, drinking alcohol, previous myocardial infarction, other cardiovascular disease and being of African American descent would require further lifestyle management.\nHeart disease is one of the leading causes of death in America and is now the leading cause of death in the UK. Having a high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, blood sugar or blood lipids levels, smoking, or eating a poor diet can all put you at risk.\nIt is only after you make the right lifestyle changes, in combination with other measures, that you can have a meaningful reduction in your blood pressure or cholesterol levels, which will reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease such as heart attack or stroke.

First, the first thing to ask from John is if your doctor prescribed medications. The NICE guidelines are based on this.\nThe next step might be to talk to him about your goals: to manage your conditions and take steps to better your health. While you\u2019re walking or standing, try to ask each of your questions:\n- Is this treatment/therapy/treatment feasible?\n- What is the benefit or difference(s)?\n- Can you make changes in lifestyle(s) that will improve your health? How will you make those changes?\n- For what purposes will you be able to deliver treatments/Therapy/Treatment (including non-pharmacological interventions) for this illness(es)?\nFinally, when you talk to, or try to talk to your doctor, it might help to ask a few more questions, too. These are good ideas:\n- What was life like before? Was he/she the type and/or intensity of illness you\u2019re experiencing?\n- Did you like/disliked your/his/her illness? Or, do you even think about it at all?\n- What were your daily responsibilities or priorities/what did you do today to make it a better situation/\n- As a result of having health issues/what made you feel like your condition/could have gone worse?\n- Are there other symptoms/pain/tenderness/blanching in your arm/neck/shoulder that indicate worsening of this issue and need for medical attention?\n- Is your diagnosis/condition/risk level high?\n- How concerned (not only financially) were you for this? How might you have acted/did/should have acted differently/not acted, and how would you describe your changes?\n- What were your treatment approaches taken to treat this?\n- For what reasons were your treatment/care interventions taken? What does this treatment/care do for you/your body?\n- What did/did people in the past do to treat/help you?\nThe NICE guidelines are based on these issues and the following conclusions:\nAt this time, non-pharmacological treatments are probably the most important interventions to improve your health. For most people, an ongoing health-related quality of life improvement would improve their quality of life and, possibly, their health. The following interventions make up the main categories:\n1. Drug(s) - Most common medication used to improve conditions, reduce symptoms, treat non-life threatening conditions (e.g. chronic pain, epilepsy, headaches, etc.)\n2. Therapies and/or treatment approaches - Some of these interventions include:\n- Lifestyle change programs like change in dietary/consumption habits, physical activity, improved diet/weight loss, lifestyle management and quitting smoking\n- Psychological (e.g. Cognitive behavioral Therapy, Mindfulness Meditation) or other interventions to reduce or manage symptoms\n- Medicines (e.g. anti-nausea drugs, anti-diarrheal drugs, antidepressants)\n- Medication management as required by your doctor\nTo learn more about the treatments mentioned above, please check the website at https://www.nice.org/", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\n\nFirst, you need to have a discussion with John and his family, as well as a look at your cholesterol and blood pressure numbers but not the above. It is not normal that your blood pressure is relatively high (that is, 120/80 or below), not a good indication of any cardiovascular disease. It is also not normal that someone with high cholesterol (5.5 mmol/L), has been smoking a few years after having a stroke and has developed coronary heart disease (which I do not think is a good idea given how common coronary artery disease is, as well as coronary heart disease has been shown to be linked to cardiovascular disease). This discussion goes into the relevant sections in this article about myocardial infarction. If you really want to be completely honest and be specific, as we will, then 1.75 mmol/L is what we would call a bad number for coronary (coronary) heart disease.\n\nSo, as far as your BP is concerned, it is very appropriate if you are only concerned about your high blood pressure. That is certainly a bad indicator.\n\nSecondly, you need to ask John a few questions about his smoking habits (yes) and whether he smokes with concern or wants to quit. How much smoking do you smoke? Well, he smokes with concern or wants to quit.\n\nHow bad does he have to feel with regards to his smoking habits if his smoking is a bad indicator of cardiovascular disease?\n\nI will have a look at John and his family over the next couple of weeks.\n\n### Week 11 - Cardiac Disease\n\n#### 11.11.2017 - Cholesterol levels and weight\n\n11/28/\n\nWeek in Review: Cholesterol and Heart Disease\n\nI'll be running a series of quizzes covering cholesterol and cardiovascular disease. I'll be following up on those last few weeks about cholesterol and blood pressure from this Monday through the Thursday and next week on cardiovascular disease (heart disease) and also general cardiovascular health. I look forward to getting to know all the questions you could make from your cholesterol and/or heart disease topics. If you would like to do a quiz, then it has been added to the slides of the forum. As the course content is so new so this was a lot of work and I have to admit that this week has been a bit more focussed on learning than I had planned. I don't know what we will be doing in this week without a quiz, however, we have to cover a whole lot of material and a lot of it will be tricky in terms of how to do it.\n\nSo, in light of this week's Ques to watch, then the next question I want to ask is:\n\nWho has higher cholesterol levels than average but has not developed heart disease?\n\n###### That will be an interesting question for me to ask myself as soon as I feel confident enough that my high cholesterol levels don't mean i've just developed heart disease which of course i should not be. I might just as well get a full check-up on my cholesterol levels as this is a possibility, even if it is not. Anyway, I think I have a good idea of my cholesterol levels and know how to work out how low my cholesterol level is (from a chart, you can just click on a section on the right to download the chart). In case you are confused as to how high my triglyceride and LDL counts are, there's a chart to download from here (link) with the instructions in it. The first chart shows my triglyceride and LDL with a value of -24mg/dl. Then there's the chart where we have listed each number on a table and then a number. I'm not sure how high my numbers are if they are less than -24. The second chart, below the triglyceride chart, I see that my numbers are not much higher if I'm not taking medication and also have low blood pressure readings. So, I think my levels are between 4.13 and 4.17.\n\nI have no problem looking at the chart and using the numbers to find out if i have high or not. However, once I have done the online calculator which can find each number on this chart, I want to make an educated guess. I have been using the calculator to figure out my Aortic Spacing (Aorta) and then how high my Aortic Peak (Aortic Peak) should be.\n\nWhat does this all mean?", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\nJohn is a good candidate for a BMI of 30 to 25. His blood pressure is above the recommended level, his LDL cholesterol level is more than 130, and his HDL level is more than 3. He is an active man with a sedentary lifestyle; he smokes and eats poorly.\nA simple blood test will screen for 1) cardiovascular risk factors, such as high cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol and high triglycerides, and 2) blood pressure control levels; these measures will help identify the right treatment plan for John.\nTo prevent his cardiovascular disease, Johnsons healthcare needs to focus on cardiovascular risk factors and blood pressure control, the NICE guidance says.\nDoctors can identify if they are at risk by doing a simple blood test that measures cholesterol and blood sugar, says the NICE guideline. However, people with high LDL and high triglycerides can be considered high risk, and this is also recommended by NICE, the official publication on cardiovascular disease.\nDoctors can use a combination of the above guidelines to determine risk to diagnose and treat it, says the NICE guideline.", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD? How might you determine if a high-risk is justified?\nPractical cardiac medicine is defined as\nthe diagnosis and management of cardiovascular diseases.\nA clinical examination can be made to guide the treatment decision for a patient. The aim is to find out (a) the age, sex, race or other demographic history of the patient\n(b) the general health of the patient. (c) the medical, psychosocial and social situation of the family. (d) all this together\nIn most cases, a cardiac assessment\ncannot be made without asking the questions \u201cWhy do you, me?\u201d or \u201cA person of your age, sex and race, what are your present and past medical and social conditions?\u201d, the patient should be asked to describe a specific illness or medical condition (and possibly a previous medical problem) and the patient should be asked how well they are doing. The questions will tell you more about your condition and your attitude to it. Sometimes physical examination can also reveal signs of a recent, or long term, heart attack, stroke, coronary artery disease or other risk factors for heart disease.\nAnother important clue that helps in making diagnostic judgements\nis the family history or of a previous history of heart attack or other forms of heart disease and/or other risks to the patient\u2019s health. For those who have a personal history of heart attack or other heart problems, you must determine if any of the factors identified by the family history have changed over time.\nSome of the risk factors include:\n- age greater than 60 years old,\n- any past history of heart attacks,\n- high cholesterol,\n- blood pressure greater than 135/80mmHg,\n- previous myocardial infarction or other heart problems,\n- recent or prior stroke or transient ischemic attack,\n- pre-existing diabetes,\n- family history of coronary artery disease or heart failure,\n- smoking; or\n- family history of chest pain (angina) or asthma.\nThis information assists physicians in making diagnosis and treatment decisions based on a diagnosis of a previous heart attack or other cardiovascular event, or other risk factors for cardiac disease.\nThe family's medical history will give you your personal risk factors (family history).\nQuestions to ask yourself when visiting your doctor:\n- Your health status, including\n- your family's medical history,\n- the medications you take,\n- how much exercise you do,\n- your daily diet and meals and/or\n- how regularly you do your exercise.\nA high-risk is a person whose risk of heart disease was higher than the rate predicted by the 95% confidence interval of the number of years people in good health with no problems had. So, if you have not been diagnosed with any heart problems or cardiovascular disease you might have a high-risk. It is helpful to remember that if a person is diagnosed with a major cardiovascular problem more often than is predicted by the 95% confidence interval, it is more likely that the individual will have an increased risk for future cardiovascular disease.\nA review of the medical history of a patient with or at risk for a CVD is recommended by the expert committee of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to help make an assessment of a person's cardiovascular risk. These risk factors include a family history of CVD or heart disease.\nThe Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) have a special group of cardiologists.

It is important to consider these recommendations when deciding on the course of treatment. This means understanding the consequences of various treatments and comparing them with the clinical outcomes of similar patients of similar cardiovascular disease risk, as this is an important factor in medical decision-making.\nThe NICE guidelines can be used as a checklist to help practitioners decide which interventions to implement on behalf of John, a 70-year-old, Chinese male. In considering the above question about cardiovascular risk, it is important to look for evidence-based guidelines to guide decision-making.\nQ1: What risk factors are relevant for the course of heart failure? What interventions should be considered if appropriate?\nQ2: What interventions are the clinical implications of considering factors such as age, previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery, obesity and hypertension?\nThe NICE guidelines can be used to assist professionals in implementing cardiac care for persons with heart failure (Q1), particularly those who have cardiovascular risk factors such as Age, Diabetes or Obesity and a previous coronary artery bypass graft. They should be considered in discussions about cardiac care.\nQ3: What interventions should be considered if appropriate interventions are not considered? How do the findings from this guidance align with recommendations from the USPSTF?\nThe guideline recommendations provide us with a good starting point to consider cardiac care. The NICE guidelines outline the main steps to take in this setting and offer a simple framework along the way. The guidelines have a strong focus on managing comorbidities as well as primary (life) care. The recommendations are based on the evidence that interventions such as lifestyle interventions, device therapies, device interventions, and pharmacotherapy can help manage hypertension, diabetes, COPD and heart failure.\nThe American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines are the latest guidelines from the American Heart Association that describe most commonly seen conditions in heart failure and cardiovascular prevention and treatment. Most of the common cardiovascular disorders were reviewed in the first edition of the 2020 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines and then updated from the revised criteria.\nThey have also been revised and updated to improve the content of the guidelines. This ensures that the recommended clinical intervention recommendations reflect the latest scientific evidence, although many of the guidelines are still broad statements that can be modified as the evidence changes.\nThe guidelines provide a common framework to discuss the most important considerations and decisions in heart failure. They are a good starting point for practitioners to reflect on how best to treat patients with heart failure. Practitioners should consider how their patient\u2019s age, history, comorbid conditions, smoking status, medication use, lifestyle, and other factors may impact the clinical care.\nQ1: Which factors, if any, are directly measurable and that should be considered in the care of people with heart failure?\nQ3: How should a clinical decision be made with regard to those factors?\nQ4: When doing a clinical decision, how should you take into account the information you obtain from the diagnosis to make an appropriate decision?\nQ5: What risk group should these factors be measured for?\nQ6: For whom should the factors be measured?\nQ7: What would be an appropriate clinical decision in a patient who has been prescribed medications and/or a cardiac device for their heart failure?\nQ8: Will the decision have an impact on an individual\u2019s other health behaviours, such as weight management, smoking, and physical activity?\nQ9: If an individual undergoes a cardiac care intervention, how long does it have to be commenced?\nQ10: What is the role of lifestyle, such as regular exercise, and diet, for people with heart failure?\nThe guidelines were developed by the World Health Organization through consensus of 50 peer-reviewed studies and an expert panel. They are based on the consensus of 500 members of the Framingham Heart Study, from the Framingham Heart Study Foundation, and the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer from University of London.

Vogt, MBBS, of the University of Washington School for Public Health, wrote his review letter in the March 16 Health Affairs issue of the journal.\nThe report, he noted, \"maintains that the best evidence suggests that heart disease is most closely associated with smoking, tobacco smoke, poor nutrition, and physical inactivity. This is especially the case for CVD, whose incidence is greatest in the third decade or so of life and which is largely preventable through a prudent dietary and exercise pattern.\"\nFurther, the review found, the magnitude of the CVD risk in this age group is \"sufficiently substantial.\"\nProfessor J. W. Vogt, commented: \"This review clearly demonstrates that tobacco smoking in particular is important in causing CVD because of a cascade of effects resulting in an accelerated increase in chronic diseases. This is particularly so in adults who are least likely to respond with lifestyle changes.\"\nS. Rajan, MD, Director of the Harvard School of Public Health, added: \"Even now, with the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ongoing economic issues in many developing nations, this study may have significant implications for prevention and control of heart disease in the future.\"", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\nNICE guidelines recommend that the following lifestyle factors in patients with CAD are at moderate or low risk: quitting smoking; maintaining high BP and heart rhythm; controlling blood pressure, reducing cholesterol; and keeping cholesterol in check through moderate cholesterol-lowering medication.\nIf the patient already has coronary heart disease, NICE strongly encourages the patient to:\n- control their cholesterol, and\n- improve their blood pressure and heart rhythm, and\n- maintain their weight, and\nIf the patient already has cardiac or circulatory conditions, NICE strongly encourages the patient to:\n- control their cholesterol and heart rhythms,\n- take prescribed cholesterol medication,\n- prevent high blood pressure,\n- maintain their weight.\nHowever, the role of lifestyle modification for managing blood pressure in patients with CAD is complicated and has not yet been studied in randomised controlled trials. For these reasons, NICE has suggested that there is no evidence that lifestyle factors can protect against heart disease in patients with CAD.\nIn April 2014 the UK's Heart Foundation presented research which shows that there are indeed some non-coronary risk factors which increase people's susceptibility to heart disease:\n- Obesity is not particularly good for the heart and the general health of a person;\n- Blood vessels have many extra blood vessels, especially those on the inner side of the heart. These vessels are used for \u2018resting\u2019 time \u2013 for storage and relaxation of the heart muscle.\n- Excess weight places an extra stress on the heart due to being higher than body weight - there's an extra load on the heart muscle.\n- High blood pressure is the leading risk factor for both heart disease and stroke.\n- Having fatty deposits found in the liver that increase liver cholesterol concentration (cirrhosis) is a risk factor for developing heart disease.\n- Having an excessive amount of triglycerides in the blood can cause problems for the heart, even if it's not the cause of coronary artery disease.\n- The American Heart Association recommends that if you do not have a family history of coronary artery disease, you should have regular examinations for risk factors that increase heart disease risk:\n- Cigarette smoking\n- Poorly controlled high blood pressure\n- Overweight/obesity\n- A family history of CVD\nThe American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association have developed criteria to diagnose coronary artery disease in the most common form called stable coronary artery disease. The criteria for diagnosing stable coronary artery disease is:\n- a pulse that is more than twice a minute at resting.\n- there's evidence of narrowing of the arteries with an increase in stiffness of the arteries caused by abnormal cholesterol within the coronary arteries.\nRisk factors for myocardial infarction and stroke include poor diet and physical inactivity, smoking, obesity, cholesterol and blood pressure levels, and whether or not the patient has a family history. This can give an idea of which lifestyle factors are likely to be at risk.", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\nThe most important thing to remember about CVD risk is that as we get older that our risk of most CVD events (heart attacks, stroke, or cardiac event) increases. The same applies to coronary mortality, which rises with age. These age-dependent risks are associated with lifestyle in turn. Here is a simplified hierarchy for how things work:\nIt makes a difference how the heart is made up of because age is also important. When you are younger the coronary arteries are more easily protected and less susceptible to damaging changes that can cause damage. A healthy lifestyle that increases the coronary arteries that provide oxygen and nutrients to the heart can be beneficial.\nA diet that improves your general health, reduces unhealthy risk factors, and lowers your risks of heart disease;\nA reduction in the number of cholesterol and triglyceride levels (preventing atherosclerosis and reducing the risk of heart disease)\nRegular exercise that improves your heart's ability to supply the heart with the oxygen required to keep it beating\nLimiting salt intake - that's what NICE recommends\nA diet full of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes (without red meat, dairy, or processed or fried foods).\nA low-fat diet that includes dairy, eggs, and lean meat (avoid those with red meat and other fats)\nA reduction in the fat in food products\nA reduction in your intake of alcohol to 1 standard drink a day\nWhen we look at our overall risk we can see how we might be losing some key factors due to age but there are also numerous age-related factors that increase CVD.\nFor example - you may inherit a gene variation that makes your blood platelets more likely to stick to your vessel walls, leading to blood clots in your heart and lungs.\nIt is very important to keep blood platelets in balance - so if the genes are going to be increased if a person gets a genetic blood-thinning inhibitor such as heparin, or if the gene is being suppressed so the platelets are not so likely to stick to the vessels. For example - after a heart attack, there may be a condition called fibrinogen (protein)uria, which would lower the blood platelets levels. Fibrinogen is a marker for the formation of clots in blood vessels and increases the risk of blood clots. The main culprit is a gene change called SLRP1 that leads to a decreased synthesis of fibrinogen.\nBlood clotting is important and is part of the body's healing process when there is a trauma (e.g., injury to the heart). However when this mechanism goes awry the body can't heal itself at the right time. If this occurs then risk of damage to the heart is increased; that is a known adverse reaction to this clotting. To learn more talk to your provider about these risk factors and to be safe.\nAnother significant risk factor over the life course is a genetic predisposition (that is, if the gene is having an impact on the risk of CVD) to develop a predisposition towards heart disease. This could not be caused by lifestyle and would have to be a specific gene-DNA locus (which is a portion of the cell-DNA) as opposed to just any other disease. These are called the \"deterministic\" loci (also used in NICE guidelines). Those that are known to trigger heart disease do not play a role in CVD risk in the non-deterministic loci.\nGenetic factors affect the susceptibility to a number of diseases, but heart disease tends to be the strongest indicator. Having a genetic heart-disease component increases the risk for CVD. It is possible to have a condition that does not cause CVD, and still develop a genetic heart-disease component. However, if the DNA locus associated with a disease has a strong association with the genetic heart disease component (not just the predisposition or susceptibility), it may be helpful to take a genetic cardiac drug that reduces that component. The choice of a drug must take into account the level of heart disease risk, the individual's age, and the type of heart disease that they have. It has also been suggested by some experts that a genetic cardiac drug can also reduce CVD risk in people who had only one cardioditricity.\nThat is not to say this does not change the risk of CVD if both risk factors are present (heart disease, a smoking history, high blood pressure) - but, that risk may not necessarily change if only one of these two has already been acquired. This is usually why a doctor will make a recommendation for you to have genetic cardiac cholesterol testing instead of a cholesterol test for each person - because it's only one", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention? The 2012 NICE Guidelines provide evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of CVD, which are published elsewhere  and are available on the Department of Health and Social Services website  and can be accessed through the NHS website. However, they do not provide detailed guidance for cardiovascular disease prevention which is not included in the NICE guidelines. As there is an extremely low prevalence of cardiovascular disease in Japan, for the purposes of this paper, the focus will be on NICE guidelines from the 'European Institute of Diabetes and Obesity' report 1. It is evident in the report that the most common age-specific CVDs are ischemic stroke with 28%, coronary heart disease with 16%, myocardial infarction with 12%, and hypertensive heart disease (HTD) with 10%. A 2015 study  provides evidence which could add to the body of evidence by providing an estimate of the burden of CVDs in Japan, using data from Japan's population-based community-based cohort, the Baka Cohort, located in Kagoshima Prefecture. In this report, the findings of the study do not provide detailed information on the results of the NICE guidelines, particularly in terms of CVD. However, both the NICE guidelines  and the Baka Cohort  provide evidence-based recommendations for the prevention of CVD and are published elsewhere, highlighting evidence on the most appropriate clinical trial strategies for CVD treatment. To improve overall UK health status, as outlined in the 2009 Health Improvement Plan 1,2 we should improve the knowledge of what types of interventions are most effective and how the best methods and treatments for CVD can be optimized and delivered by the health care service providers. The aim of this paper is to discuss whether there is a need for community-based trials in the prevention of CVD and the use of randomized clinical trials. In this regard, the review identifies examples of community-based trials on the prevention of CVD and demonstrates the need to improve the approach for these trials through the identification of relevant public health programmes that directly treat CVD and which are cost-effective, and which follow clearly laid out research protocols, and evidence-based guidelines to guide the study design, sample selection and risk assessment. An examination of how the study design can be used to increase the coverage of evidence based guidelines and ensure the prevention of CVD and the use of a 'cluster randomized controlled trial' (MRCT.) to identify whether there is sufficient evidence for evidence-based guidelines to produce an improvement. Key areas investigated include: - \u2022 the impact of community-based trials in CVD prevention and the use of randomisation to investigate health outcomes,  - \u2022 the identification of key clinical risk factors in which the benefit of community based trials would be greatest - and - \u2022 the development and implementation of interventions to promote cardiovascular health in order to improve overall UK health status.\nCite this paper\n1.

Does this sound familiar to you or someone you know (e.g. the former prime minister of Malawi)? While other CVD risk factors may differ, the overall aim of the NICE guidelines remains the same: to reduce CVD mortality in the UK populations.\nAs part of the NICE work and as part of an interprofessional team working closely with NICE, Dr. Sondera and colleagues from the UK were invited to undertake an in-depth examination of the findings of the 2013 NICE guidelines, and their recommendations for intervention strategies for reducing CVD mortality. Their purpose was to understand the specific features of disease and intervention approaches, as well as to ascertain what the latest clinical evidence shows can be useful to healthcare professionals when making decisions about CVD prevention.\nThe NICE guidelines use the term 'interventions' as the umbrella term encompassing all strategies that aim to support CVD prevention - from non-pharmaceutical measures (the common term for such things as healthy eating and exercise) to prescription drugs (the use of medicines to prevent or treat CVD conditions). As the NICE guidelines discuss these interventions, the definition of the term 'control' includes measures to prevent CVD or the progression to CVD (e.g. weight management, smoking cessation, lowering blood pressure, reducing blood fats, reducing LDL), alongside measures to help treat CVD (e.g. drugs, surgery).\nThe 'control' measures included in this 'combination treatment' approach are often referred to as CVD Prevention Modules (CPMs). By comparing NICE guidelines to standard practices that are already common in selected UK population subgroups (such as primary care consultations for common causes of cardiovascular disease) we developed NICE guidelines on the specific role that the CPM may play in CVD prevention to help clinicians understand how they can use the NICE guidelines to achieve outcomes of interest.\nAs part of the NICE consultations on risk factors related to CVD, our team was able to conduct in-depth discussions with the expert opinion for this study: Dr Alan Sondera from NICE, Dr Janis Kappe from Oxford University and Dr Michael Green from the University of Manchester. In the discussion between these experts, Dr Sondera and Gareth Jones from NICE explained that the focus of the paper should have been to determine whether the NICE guidelines in their title as 'well-meaning' or 'wise' have relevance to CVD. To this end, we performed a qualitative survey in three English primary care services that were part of a cluster network, to attempt to identify community participants and stakeholders who had the appropriate knowledge, understanding and confidence to act upon the recommendations and/or their clinical experience of them.\nThe team used a range of questionnaires and interviews for the paper, including our own questions based on the NICE guidelines for managing high blood pressure and an online survey of stakeholders which provided evidence-based and consensus-based interventions that have been tried and evaluated in the UK.\nThe results and conclusions will be published in the latest issue of The Canadian Medical Association Journal (September 2019). We can be further commended for being open and honest with us about what we used to suggest that certain practices in the NICE guidelines are not particularly relevant to CVD prevention - so the paper needs to be revised to include evidence about practice that is relevant and most likely to contribute to reducing CVD mortality rates.\nSo, how much risk should we take when taking a step towards reducing CVD risk? The answer is, more than you realise.\nIn the latest NICE guidelines for managing high blood pressure, NICE advises you to take action by controlling your diabetes in order to lower your blood pressure.\nThe NICE guidelines suggest that lifestyle interventions \u2013 for example, reducing the amount of sugar and sodium in your diet, and exercising regularly \u2013 are probably the most cost effective lifestyle factor to reduce cholesterol and increase your HDL levels.\nHowever, the expert advice is based on a range of different clinical evidence as well as a range of professional and clinical advice that may not always agree with the NICE guidelines. NICS does not recommend any specific treatment intervention per se - in fact, it is important to take some time to weigh up the pros and cons of different lifestyle interventions and treatments in order to see which may be the most useful to you.\nWhen making decisions about lifestyle interventions and therapies, there are certainly reasons to accept that reducing high blood pressure is likely to be a cost efficient option and could cut risk significantly. Nonetheless, there are also several situations where exercise training or medications are the appropriate treatment course for patients with high blood pressure without an ideal level of blood pressure,", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\nThe guideline for primary prevention of CVD may be 60% - 90% effective if achieved.

It was released last month.\nThe data are based on public health surveillance in Brazil from 1997-2017 to the second-most populous country of the Americas.\nThe authors were keen to identify the risk profiles of people at risk and the proportion with or without a heart abnormality.\n\"Heart diseases were the second highest risk factor in people who were less than 50 years old from 1997-2017,\" said Dr. Galle Cao, senior author of the clinical trial. \"But it is important to understand how they differ for a high-risk population. There are different risk profiles with age.\"\n\"The risk for CVD was a key driver of the development of our hypothesis that people with and without heart abnormalities have different risk profiles. They ranged from below the threshold of risk for heart abnormalities in adults to more than eight times their risk for people with a heart abnormality.\"\nCao and other colleagues used the WHO Global Cardiovascular Disease Database and Study Network to find out who had a heart abnormality before age 60 and who had had a heart abnormality and the age at which it developed.\n\"We looked at records from 481,824 Portuguese respondents who were aged between 30 and 69 years. In 2015 the median of years of education was 48.2,\" said Dr. Galle Cao. \"The odds of having a heart abnormality were upsurge in those who had an education of 48.2 years: 1.818 (95% CI, 1.104-2.755) vs 1.352 (95% CI, 1.042-2.167), for those without an education of that 48.2 years.\nTheir results showed that the highest education levels were 33.95 (95% CI, 32.87-34.51), 11.71 (95% CI, 10.01-13.39) and 23.9 (95% CI, 22.26-26.20) compared with those with less than a minimum educational level for all the years under study.\nIt is important to define the risks of CVD in people who did not have any form of abnormal heart anatomy.\n\"Previous research has shown that it is difficult to identify the group that needs help to get their level of education, and this has complicated the process,\" said Dr. Galle Cao. \"Our data show that it is possible to identify people who could benefit from screening when they are at lowest risk or when the risk is low.\"", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention? The expert panel that devised the current NICE guideline for CVD prevention, which includes both screening and diagnosis, has identified cardiovascular risk factors as being \"strongly and consistently associated with CVD risk\", which includes \"high blood pressure (hypertension), dyslipidaemia (high levels of lipids in the blood not explained by obesity), type 2 diabetes (the same conditions that cause hypertension) and smoking,\" to name just a few.\nNICE also identifies the need for \"cardio-preventive therapy\" as a 'highly-sensitive' assessment, but they are particularly interested in patients with certain genetic markers, that may be associated with CVD risk, but are not on the NICE guidelines. These include elevated low-density lipoproteins (LDL), total cholesterol and triglycerides, or abnormalities, which are often a primary indicator of CVD risk.\n\"The NICE guidelines recognise that not all patients with CVD present with evidence-based risk factors, and some will not be eligible for screening,\" said Mr Hau, who is also a member of the Department for Health Commissioned Project Lead of the NICE Guideline Collaboration. \"In addition, there is often a lack of information available to patients, and many people don't know what screening and testing tools to look for, and what is the normal range. This is especially problematic if a patient is a victim of CVD and doesn't take care of their weight loss, smoking behaviour or dietary habits.\"\nFor patients, the expert panel recommendations can also help predict the potential impact of CVD on the long-term health in patients, which includes the risk of cognitive impairment, cardiovascular disease (CVD), premature death, need for hospital care and hospitalisation with diabetes and chronic kidney disease.\nThe guide, which was developed using NICE's existing guidance and guidelines, however, is still under review for the new guidelines, which are expected to be drawn up by NICE in October.\n\"NICE guidance recommends that screening and diagnosing patients for CVD is a high priority for health professionals at all levels, but it is still up to patient, healthcare professional and community leaders to understand the potential impact on their patients,\" said Mr Hau. \"This guide can help guide these roles.\"", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention? Consider the following: A prospective cohort study in which 150,000 patients were included with an estimated combined life expectancy of 60 years and an incidence of cardiovascular disease as an independent risk factor, 45% had a previous myocardial infarction (MI); a combined history of heart failure with stable symptoms prior to diagnosis; and only 40% smoked tobacco, and the study population had a normal EKG. Based on a potential association between smoking and CVD the NICE guidelines were: Smoking cessation in early pregnancy should proceed until 32 weeks of gestation; follow up should be given during delivery; women should be reassured that they are unlikely to experience complications of pregnancy or induce maternal illness; there are no substantial additional costs because of the reduction of risk of heart failure. The guideline would not be appropriate in patients who meet the other important criteria, as the risk of MI is expected to be lower.\nCardiovascular disease in children is a medical problem that affects their physical development and that needs to be considered as part of their well-being. Given the increasing numbers of young children being diagnosed with and surviving heart disease, which have some serious health and cognitive repercussions, this literature review of the medical literature should be of interest to paediatricians. These guidelines are also relevant to paediatric cardiologists. The NICE guideline is: Children and their parents should have a clear understanding and ability to determine the health risks of an additional member of the family.\nThe general practice in Wales at midlife is characterised by 2 general guidelines: (1) no smoking (2) no alcohol\nto be considered 'hazardous'. (3) No smoking, alcohol and poor diet are to be considered at the same level.\nMany people are 'pre-disposed' to heart disease, such as being obese - this increases one's risk. There are 2 different types of cardiovascular disease - coronary heart disease and stroke - which are closely linked but with different definitions. Most people are only at risk for stroke if they are a history of stroke or a previous stroke. However a healthy lifestyle can reverse the risk factor and a stroke can happen to one who has never suffered a stroke. Smoking should be avoided if at any moment there is a suspicion of a heart attack. Smoking also increases the risk of heart disease because tobacco decreases the production of a crucial hormone called lipoprotein lipase (which is critical for maintaining healthy cholesterol levels) that reduces LDL cholesterol levels. Regular exercise will also reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease (21). While this advice is very much based on the old theory of three components to healthy heart, there is evidence that the combination of lifestyle factors for heart disease - smoking, lifestyle choices, and obesity - improves the likelihood of recovery from a heart attack (32). The NHS Heart Score helps identify risk factors for heart disease through a simple online questionnaire, but it does not include all the 3 lifestyle factors. In a recent report a questionnaire was designed that does have both the information on smoking and lifestyle factors, but they only focus on smoking and the three lifestyle factors - diet, exercise, and alcohol. Whilst this study will be particularly influential in those areas of particular concern in England, it is an interim report and the NICE guideline does not provide detailed detailed advice on the components that influence heart disease prevention.\nFor individuals with a current history of heart disease the NICE guidelines recommend a first round of lifestyle change. This includes advice on getting a cholesterol profile from a professional. This may be a simple review of the blood test to see how high the cholesterol level is, since it may indicate the risk of heart attack. Another approach is to see a doctor and have an electrocardiogram (EPG). For people aged 45 to 74 years old who have had cardiovascular disease with a risk of either MI or heart failure, heart disease and statin treatment should be started at the same time. This could help lower the risk of developing cardiovascular disease by reducing the chances of a heart attack. For those over 70 years of age and with a normal EKG, there is a general guideline. One approach is to have a simple EKG (Electrocardiogram - EKG). There are many things to consider though:\nFor patients aged 45 to 74 years old at the moment if you are aged 45 to 74 there are no health and mental changes that may be relevant to health and wellbeing. We should consider how your social life is, your level of activity and your health, to provide the right health and mental care for you. For people at this age", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\nCVD prevention: The aim for the next 10 years will be to prevent 5.5% of all CVDs and 10% of all deaths per year, based on the guideline approach to heart conditions.\nWe\u2019ll look at what NICE guidelines give to cardiologists and their patients to take action in CVD prevention.\nThis document provides a summary of NICE guidelines. It includes all of the relevant guidelines, guidance documents, other resources, patient information, and the availability of further resources. The document also includes important updates for 2017 to 2025.\nThe NICE guidelines provide advice for prevention of major CVDs (heart disease and stroke) to be implemented within five years to provide a 30% reduction in coronary heart disease mortality by 2030. The majority of CHD (cardiovascular disease) deaths in the UK will be attributed to preventable CHD.\nHeart disease is more than just a blockage. CHD involves a number of factors, not just heart attacks but heart diseases that cause a lot of problems in a person\u2019s life, such as heart attack and stroke:\n- the risk factors for these complications: smoking, high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol, high blood sugar, unhealthy eating habits and some types of cancer.\n- the type and degree of a CHD and other lifestyle factors.\nOur health advice will involve looking at all the risk factors to assess to determine the best strategy to prevent CHD with the most benefit for all of the people affected. This means taking care of heart health before there is a CHD. Here are some key areas of heart health to consider which are especially important in understanding your likelihood of developing heart disease and the best way to avoid it.\n- physical exercise\n- keeping to a healthy diet\n- taking regular medicines as prescribed by your doctor\n- to manage your family medical history\n- taking medicines when prescribed\n- taking steps to reduce stress.\nThe primary point of the guidance is to avoid the development of CHD before it happens and the best way to do this is by ensuring that you are at a healthy weight, have a high quality diet, exercise regularly, and do not smoke.\nCataracts, Macular Degeneration and Freezing of Vision Screening\nCataracts are a disease of the eye that affects up to 80% of the population. They are the leading cause of blindness in the UK.\nThis guideline is used to help to identify those at risk of developing cataract and macular degeneration and to support people who are taking action from screening through to early intervention.\nThe NHS recommends NHS screening for diabetic retinopathy only starting at age 45 and stopping at age 65 to minimise risks of developing other complications of diabetes and diabetic retinopathy. The NHS does not recommend this treatment for all types of diabetic retinopathy until they are diagnosed.\nFreezing of vision screening can be a useful screening tool to identify those at risk of developing cataract. It is intended to use the NHS screening algorithm. We recommend freezing of vision screening for those aged 55 or 65 years without any sight loss and those at average risk of developing cataract within the next decade following their screening.\nGlaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the UK, after cataracts. It involves damage to the optic nerve, where the information about the world is sent to the brain. Glaucoma can damage the optic nerve if left untreated.\nThis guideline is used to identify those who may need early diagnosis and treatment for glaucoma to avoid the development of complications and to reduce the risk of blindness. People aged 65 and over have the lowest early detection rate in Northern England.\nIt\u2019s important to understand this guideline is to be proactive, not a punitive technique that is a burden for those at risk of the disease.\nThe treatment for glaucoma is to improve the visual field of those with glaucoma. It involves an anti-refraction approach where the patient is provided with lenses that are used by an optometrist to increase the visual field. The patients must wear the lenses for at least 15 to 30 minutes at a time. The most effective type of anti-refraction lens is a Fraction 12 which is a non-penetrable, anti-refractive lens.\nThis guideline is used to assess all patients who are having a risk assessment and plan for future treatment.\nThe NHS recommends if a person needs to be referred to an eye specialist, a person aged 65 years or over should be referred to an", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\nWhile NICE is not a regulatory authority in terms of prescribing medicines (as they are in the UK), the public awareness of the need for lifestyle modification, and the availability of evidence-based guidelines around CVD risk reduction should lead to more evidence-based practice guidance.\nNICE continues to advocate for a systematic approach to CVD risk modification within primary care - a practice which has been successfully implemented in the NHS by the Health Professions and Technical Standards for Healthcare Practitioners network, providing a consistent method of measuring effectiveness of health care interventions.", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\nQ1.

A diet reduction to lose weight and increase exercise\n2. Regular exercise, which is very important, particularly aerobic exercise (most people don't exercise enough).\n3. A healthy, low Saturated Fat, and Low Glycemic Index food choice for most people.

On the network, nodes can be connected using layers.\nA data-transfer node (node 1) sends a datelink to a layer 1 node (data-transfer node 2), which sends a datelink to a layer 2 node (data-transfer node 3), which sends a datelink to a layer 3 node (data-transfer node 4), and so on. The first layer to which both nodes come is called a node1. The second layer is called node2. When a node1 receives data from a user, it sends data to a different layer. This user does not get any data from the data-transfer node 3: it receives some data and receives the rest from the third layer of the network. A user receives data from the user's phone when she talks to the data-transfer node, but not all the data is sent there. If the user's phone has a function similar to a touch screen, she uses the touch screen so that she receives data from the user (data-transfer node 3). If the user has good eyesight, then the user uses a magnifying glass app, so that she receives data from the user (data-transfer node 2).\n\nA person wants to contact a user through a data-message node (node 3) to provide him with a picture of a dog.

The node 3 and the user agree that the user needs to send her a picture if a photo of her friend will not show due to something going on in the life of the user. The data-delivery node 3 tells the node 3 whether the user wants to send a picture to the node 3, which means whether the node 3 can send any pictures. If the node 3 does not send the picture of the dog, the user receives the picture of the dog.

Even with a relatively few exceptions, the \"hard cases\" of cholesterol, inflammation, hypertension and sedentary lifestyle are all too often the culprits, and some of them aren't completely preventable, including smoking. I.E., if your heart disease goes untreated, your arteries will narrow and become stiffer. And your heart will have to work twice as hard to pump blood through your body. So even if you haven't identified any risk factor, if you don't take advantage of it at all, the odds are that your heart will be much more likely to be damaged by things like tobacco (which is a major risk factor) and some types of infection (which also puts you at risk for heart damage).\nHere's my two cents about John.\nOne thing I've noticed is that in my patients we talk about \"cardiac benefits\" rather than \"cardiovascular benefits\". I can't even tell you how many patients have stated that the \"cardiac benefits\" of the medications mentioned here, while some others didn't get their benefits the other way around.\nWell, in my book I've talked about people with \"cardiac benefits\" as having more \"cardiovascular benefits\" compared to non-cardiac benefits. I'd say that a lot of patients will describe their patients as going in the \"cardiac benefits\", so I've noticed too many times in the previous few blogs that they are very specific about \"cardiac benefits,\" but don't talk about \"cardiovascular benefits.\"\nI think there are 2 reasons why so many people have gotten this sort of misinformation.\nFirst, the media is extremely biased. Every major news source is a \"news-hockey\" with no bias whatsoever. People who read a local, or national, news outlet have a pretty direct vision on what is going on. This is why I think most people do get the misinformation about cardioprotective medications when they are on the Internet.\nSecond, many of these media outlets are funded by big pharmaceutical companies. Their stock has been historically down and down since 1999.\nThese big pharmaceutical companies tell the wrong stories and tell people in the wrong frame of mind. They tell people to believe that, with the current diet they have, there is no harm in eating meat. But, with the current diet, I am 170 pounds over the recommended 2000 calories a day. I eat 2 chicken wings every day, and 3 eggs every day. And for those who say \"The right nutrition\" and \"The wrong nutrition\", that's just the reverse of the facts.\nMany of these media outlets also claim, \"Many people think smoking is dangerous.\" And while that is true, almost no one ever has used that word \"tobacco\". And so the false image that \"It is cancer,\" and \"it is really bad at keeping people young and healthy,\" is now the belief of many. And therefore many people are told there is a correlation between smoking and heart disease, and are told to quit smoking as soon as they do. And yet, I have never heard of anyone with heart disease or diabetes who has never smoked. In fact, many people I meet believe that smoking is a \"crisis\" for the human body and the need for so many medical interventions to combat this.\nSo, to get into the main question, is there anything I can do for John?\nYes, he can be a part of the solutions. In this blog we try to look at ways that we can prevent CHD by taking care of the heart, as well as lowering blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels (no matter if you are non-cardiovascular or cardiovascular, and regardless of whether you are overweight or not). But we also take care of ourselves physically. We are aware of our health concerns and take charge of our own health by eating to be healthy, exercising, and being physically active. I have a doctor called, John who works on many medical issues in his practices and who will help us to get back on the road to a happy, healthy, healthy life.\nMy goal is to see that John does just that. This is not a quick, quick fix, I promise! This isn't easy,", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\n- You might have a CVD risk factor. In the above example, you may have had long-term exposure to smoking.\n- Your lifestyle, in particular, would have contributed to your CVD risk. You've probably already been told to cut down on your sodium consumption, and perhaps this is what prompted your BP to continue rising above the normal range between appointments. Your doctor might have advised you to adopt a Mediterranean lifestyle with healthy eating, regular exercise and stress-relieving activities.\n- You've been told to exercise. It might be to do with all the exercise and how active you are. The American Journal of Medicine (2007) describes several studies that found that more active men have a reduced risk for mortality from CVD. You might have been told to exercise regularly to have it on your list of priorities when you see a physician for your first CVD diagnosis.\n- You could have an autoimmune disease. A gluten-free diet, or an individual with celiac disease can be highly effective in lowering high blood pressure and triglyceride levels. Blood lipid profiles can be improved by restricting trans-fats and trans-lipids.\n- You might not have had a genetic predisposition to the disease. There's no evidence that this is the reason for the increase in the number of people who have CVD. There might be some environmental risk factors. An example is that smoking cigarettes increases the risk for diabetes because smoking raises LDL levels.\nIf you're looking for general information about the causes of heart disease or other health problems, a basic definition of what is meant by a cause would probably be helpful. Here's the basics:\n- Cardiovascular disease refers to the medical condition of the blood vessels, that include the arteries, veins, and capillaries. It can be caused by anything that slows the flow of blood in the arteries/veins, such as coronary artery disease or heart attacks. (In this case, the cause of heart disease is coronary artery disease.)\n- A medical diagnosis would usually show up on an EKG (electrocardiogram) of the heart. This test will note an irregular heartbeat; when the heartbeat is normal, the EKG is going to show up.\n- The EKG shows an irregular heartbeat, which is one type of abnormality you may have called an arrhythmia. An arrhythmia is a temporary disruption of the heartbeat pattern in the heart that may last for several minutes. There will be slight variations in rhythm. An arrhythmia must be checked if you think you may have an arrhythmia.\n- The arrhythmia is caused by any change in your heart's natural rhythm. One type of arrhythmia is called ventricular tachycardia. It occurs when the electrical signal that controls the heartbeat is lost and the heart contracts unusually too quickly. This sudden and irregular heartbeat is rapid and can lead to dizziness, fainting, and eventually cardiac arrest. Other types of arrhythmia cause a slow and irregular heartbeat. These include atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia.\n- Electrocardiogram (ECG, also known as electrocardiogram or EKG) is the most common type of EKG (Electrocardiogram) that is available. An ECG is a recording of your heart's electrical signals by taking a series of electronic images of the heart. The pictures can show what is normal and what is abnormal based on electrical activity of the heart. The heart is normally beating at the rate of 60 beats per minute in adults, but one in the EKG may look like this:\n- The heart's electrical system shows up on the EKG screen. This test makes it possible to get an educated guess as to what is wrong with your heart rhythm. If the heart is normal, the picture will show very little heart rhythm disturbances.\n- Abnormal rhythms may show up on a second test called an EKGs, or the ECG alone. The abnormal waveforms are usually not strong enough to tell you what is wrong with your heart. But a number of factors seem to affect normal and abnormal rhythms. These are referred to as cardiovascular disease risk factors. They include a history of heart attack, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, or being male.\n- Normal EKG (electrocardiogram)\n- The normal pattern of an ECG may be seen on an adult test on a scale from one to 10. The normal test result for a 70-year-old man is about 0 and this is the average. Men are more likely to have abnormal results.\n- The normal result for a 70-year-old man without a family", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\n\nJohn currently lives alone in Beijing, but in the UK he works as a freelance journalist and spends most of his time travelling - for work, home, or simply to pursue his hobbies.\n\nHis email: xiaojie\nCofounder / CEO of 'HeartHealthy' (http://www.hearthealthy.co.za)\n\nI have had a friend in the US who claims that they have successfully managed both their high cholesterol and diabetes. It is based on the advice of a professional that's seen this sort of kind of damage happen in the next 5 years because the body is reacting to the environment more through its metabolism than it is through its cholesterol and its blood sugar levels. So they recommend that they switch to a diet that has less saturated fat, and more omega 3s, which they say is what they need to have their blood sugar levels reduced enough to be able to go without drugs or be on pills for two to five years; but without these they feel their triglyceride levels have increased to a point where they cannot afford medication, and they're starting to make the kind of lifestyle choices that can reverse their health.\n\nIf John is going to switch to such a diet they want him to stick to this for the next 5 years, and make their blood sugar levels go down, but not to the 'normal' level for four years to be able to live a normal life and work comfortably, even if it doesn't reduce his risk of type 2 diabetes or heart disease. And John doesn't seem to have had a lot of trouble with high cholesterol at that point, but by then the liver has to do a lot more work to clear stuff out of it, which is about 10% of cholesterol, with a lot of that being 'bad cholesterol'. John has been experiencing bouts of low HDL cholesterol for a week or 2 every couple of weeks for the past 3 years, and it makes him worry about his health even if a year out of hospital.\n\nSo what should he change? How fast could she switch to something healthier? Here are some of the basic principles I would suggest.\n\nThe 'DASH diet' (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) is based on 3 principles:\n\n\u2022 Eat plenty of green vegetables\n\u2022 Eat lots of legumes\n\u2022 Eat lots of fish and lean meat\n\u2022 Eat plenty of fruit, nuts, and vegetable oils (Oils) such as olive oil\n\nThey have shown that the DASH diet, although very rich in vegetable oils, has a small effect on the blood pressure level, but there is probably a lot more to this than this, in general: some evidence shows that it lowers the risk of cardiovascular events, but it also cuts down one type of cholesterol called LDL (low density lipoprotein), which we don't know much about. I just have no idea if this will be true for John \u2013 so it could be that he is probably going to start taking statins (cholesterol-lowering drugs) and then stop it soon, but I don't know whether that's what he's doing.\n\nThe 'DASH diet was shown to cut down triglyceride levels by as much as 19% in one clinical trial. It is still thought to work because it is less saturated fat, so if you can live well without it you should. At about 15% of your HDL it is the same as 100mg of statins (although there is some uncertainty about this due to the lack of control groups in the clinical trials). So if John is not losing weight the most important thing that is now on his mind is how well he is taking his statins, and especially those that have a 'low' potential for weight gain, so it makes good sense that you should stick to them: if the benefits of being on them are low it's better to stop taking them rather than the risk if they come off.\n\nJohn's cholesterol levels are rising. It's probably going up now as a consequence of a 5-year binge of sugar and fatty food (such as bacon) and the other issues, such as being overweight and being obese. He can't get there with any kind of exercise, and he tends to get fat fast without really trying, but he can still be in a sedentary lifestyle. It's easy to switch over to the diet on the DASH, but if John still has been doing 'diet' things for a while, he should definitely try the DASH diet again; if he sticks with that, he", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\nThere are some very compelling recommendations:\n- Lifestyle changes: You need to get into an easy lifestyle, not a fast weight loss regimen. This is why I advocate for a more physical and active way to look after yourself. (For more guidance, see my previous post, Lifestyle modification \u2013 how to lose weight.)\n- Physical inactivity: People without diabetes need to get up at some point and go for a walk at lunchtime. In fact, at the start of the day, jogging or brisk walking would be ideal. But if the person cannot walk, then it may be easier to do some other activity such as cycling or swimming instead - which is not just another way to burn abdominal fat, but one that has even more advantages for you. Remember also that any amount of activity is better than no activity at all, and if you can't even do one activity at a time, have another session on some other day.\n- The diet, which affects the metabolism: Diets with high calories and low fibre can be hard to follow. In particular, people with obesity who consume less fibre are likely to gain weight. They also have a lower percentage of muscle mass. People with diabetes also have a lower muscle mass and a lower percentage of body fat. These factors put a particular emphasis on fibre.\n- The type of food: For both types of body weight management, people with diabetes should eat more fiber. However, there is no definitive evidence that the type of food consumed will affect weight gain in your blood. If you choose a whole grain breakfast or whole milk cereal, they both seem to be less detrimental to weight gain than refined grains.\n- The alcohol: You should exercise a little more, eat less if you drink more, and limit the amount of alcohol you drink. People who are diabetic should limit their alcohol intake and, for those who want to have one, limit it to 1-2 glasses a week.\n- Lifestyle modifications, based on the diet recommendations: The weight management advice will be different for people with diabetes and those without, and the type of diet must be based on the individual. A healthy, balanced diet should include protein, carbohydrates, and fats that are good for the body and, especially, should be high quality and that promotes good health. There are also some other things you should add to your list, such as low-fat dairy products and lots of vitamin water.\n- Exercise: People with diabetes should not exercise on a regular basis, at all. It is thought that the high intensity training, which is often advocated by the diabetes experts, may only worsen the condition. If you have diabetes or want to exercise, it wouldn't hurt to practice a series of five minutes of brisk walking in a day.\nIn conclusion: The key is for people with diabetes to start with a slow and level-off plan (as there are several others that sound similar) and to gradually build up to a more intense plan, if you are able to do so. It is important to have regular tests and see a physician if you have any concerns.\nWhen someone has diabetes it can be a hard sell, but for many people, and for their loved ones, having diabetes can be a very happy story. If you have diabetes or want to prevent the disease, here are the answers - don't be surprised if you need to get a diagnosis of diabetes, find a specialist, and then find new and exciting ways to treat, prevent, and manage your condition. Here are some advice for each of my recommendations:\n- Know your risk: Everyone has some degree of risk of developing diabetes of 1-5% if you have the diseases listed on the risk list. Your individual risk is influenced by your own risk factors, as well as by your family, personal and environmental history, and in the long run, your lifestyle. People with these types of conditions should take some action to lower their risk. The focus of this list is on the type of disease and the risk of developing it. It is also worth noting that you are not alone with your risk factors, and your doctor or dietitian can help you to gain awareness and reduce/prevent your risk.\nIt's important to be aware of the risk factors, so that you can make lifestyle changes to reduce the risk. There is also more that can be done in different ways to reduce your risk, to help you live a healthier and happier life, and to prevent the disease if you do contract diabetes.\n- Know your risk: Some of the risk factors for diabetes are known to exist, but others can't be controlled (or at least can", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD? If John could apply to a specialist, would he be eligible to be recommended for NICE guidance? I realise that it will depend upon a) the length of time he has lived with CVD, and b) the extent of his current disease, and c) whether or not John has ever been diagnosed with a particular form of CVD, but I can't be sure. My first instinct is that this could be a difficult situation to deal with, and my second feeling is that it is likely to be a very difficult one - even if I had to find a physician in the first instance. Is there anything I can do to alleviate the stress?\nI have heard of the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention, so may I ask any one, what would be the next steps for John's life, before this becomes an emergency?\nThe NICE guidelines for CVD prevention are an essential tool for many of our patients. Whether a patient is diagnosed, or not, they should have access to an accurate diagnosis, which will help them in the future in choosing a preventative action. Although there is an urgent need in the UK for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to develop more guidelines for controlling the effects of smoking, this is not something we can do over the telephone/online or by appointment alone.\nThe guidelines describe and recommend a range of lifestyle interventions that can help prevent a number of disorders, especially if the patient is a non-smoker. The evidence is there, but the decision to recommend a specific preventive action, especially to those in a high risk category (high fat, high salt, poor diet, high alcohol consumption) is not always clear - so it is important to remember the limitations of clinical judgement - even a person with a known CVD can sometimes respond to a certain lifestyle (e.g. diet and exercise) and may not need to be advised to take a particular preventative action. So, I would not recommend that John's not have a blood pressure monitor, he has never smoked, and has a family history of CVD.\nHaving said that, I would be very concerned that John's current smoking is very limited, but I am concerned that the NICE guidelines have yet to consider this as a possibility. I would be delighted if John's GP (or another GP) would check the medications or other advice he is given to limit his smoking to help protect him from many of the above diseases if he chooses that approach, and if he is a person with a certain lifestyle (low fat and/or low alcohol consumption) and uses these drugs, may consider adding a tobacco tax to the patient's benefit package.\nIf you or someone you know is on the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention, please feel free to use it to provide general information, and discuss the matter with your doctor. The NICE guidelines for CVD prevention focus on risk factors and risk factors associated with CVD.

The question may be to assess whether the patient has an underlying CVD.\n\nIn the first case, I think L-arginine supplements have been successful, with one study indicating that they are slightly more effective than placebo in controlling arterial hypertension. They are also thought to support the uptake of L-arginine in the kidney, and a possible role for the kidney in blood pressure regulation - a point to be clearly distinguished with future research.\n\nIn the second case, I would suggest that his current BP is more than a hundred points over normal values - an indication that he is having difficulties with his CVD and/or hypercoagulability needs attention, and it is the time before we start treatment.\n\nIn the third case, if there is a problem with the pH imbalance, the bicarbonate buffer in the nephron might have altered. This would suggest a condition where the citrate buffer might be deficient, as well. If the condition is severe, he could have a large haemorrhage which would require urgent removal of the affected segment.\n\nAnd for L-arginine supplements, we must check, in a context of the individual's history, that the supplement is compatible with his current health. I would recommend they be continued on an all-natural basis, while consulting one of the many online forums for advice on complementary and alternative medicine.\n\nSo in some cases, L-arginine supplements are not enough on their own.\n\nPingback by The Role of Dietary Supplements in Managing Chronic Disease Risk | The Healthy Lifestyle Blog \u00ab Binge? \u00bb\n\nThere will be a short discussion of the role of dietary supplements in managing chronic disease risk. What we will cover is not only the mechanism of action, the risk of disease, and the cost, but the clinical implication of many supplements (dietary, herbal and/or vitamin) in managing the risk of disease. A summary of this discussion, to complement the discussion of the issue about a dietary supplement, will be available in a separate series at http://binge.medindia.net/\n\u2022 And this discussion is happening right?\n\nYes, people who engage in extreme behaviours are more likely to develop chronic conditions such as high cholesterol. Lifestyle behaviours have been found to be a major risk factor for cardiometabolic disease. Even a brief period of intense exercise in a short period of time (15-30min) will increase the risk of diabetes in certain individuals; a single bout of intense exercise does not appear to increase the risk of hypertension.\n\u2022 What is the purpose of nutritional supplements?\n\nMany nutrients do cause inflammation in our bodies which causes inflammation in the arteries. We might have thought that the anti-inflammatory properties of certain nutrients would keep us pain free but we have found that the presence of certain substances in a diet can promote the production of excessive inflammation in our bodies - and this results in inflammation of the organs and body tissues lining the blood-brain barrier and central nervous system. This leads to damage from the release of inflammatory substances such as tumor necrosis factor, tumor necrosis factor receptor, and IL-1\u03b2; this can lead to tissue dysfunction and/or accelerated senescence.\n\n\u2022 What are the potential long term effects of using nutritional supplements, how does this work and is there a way to identify them, if at all (I'm a medical doctor and I've helped patients use complementary and alternative medicine)?\n\nI see this at some point in my life, when I was a medical doctor and I started looking for holistic approaches to chronic diseases. I've now become a specialist in complementary and alternative medicine, and I've seen many people using various forms of nutritional supplements as part of their natural remedies. For the long term this can be beneficial, but there are not any big enough numbers to say that it is safe (especially given the time and cost involved). I will definitely stay aware of these, and I'd just really like to help others to keep abreast of the use of this in their health system and their lifestyle environments.\n\nIn a world that seems to have just moved out of the paleo world, what is the need for nutritional supplements? I don't really see any reason for going on this; it's probably not worth it, but in the interest of the patient in the long run\n\u2022 So what sort of health benefit is there to you?\n\nI don't know much about cancer yet, so I do not have any experience with this form of treatment for cancer.

If you are overweight at the moment, you should lose a full kilo a week. If the same weight loss is not possible, you may need to lose a single kilo or less a day so that your weight is maintained at a normal body mass index then.\n\nThere are also risks associated with excess weight\n\nIt may not be your fault, as the risk of diabetes increases as extra pounds pile up. However, not being overweight does not eliminate the risk.\n\nThe fact is most people are not overweight, so a weight management programme to lose and maintain weight might be a good idea, but don't make all the money out of it.\n\nWhen your body weight is above 120kg it will be 4 times stronger as a result of diabetes, and 9 times stronger as a result of excessive BMI.

NICE guidelines recommend that John should get exercise three times a week (200 minutes a week) to reduce his risk and reduce his hypertension. John's exercise routine should be a mix of aerobic activity such as brisk walking, home-based running, high-intensity interval training, strength training (sitting and standing lift), and balance training - where he can stand up and change to sit when his back gets stiff. If he is using an exercise machine and exercises for 75 minutes in 20 minutes, he should walk two, three or four times a week. And finally, a regular telephone check-in with his regular health practitioner would be required, at least twice a month to ensure John's exercise routine is up to date and to confirm that his symptoms are improving.", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\nThe good news: it is not too late to take advantage of a few simple lifestyle changes. What we need most of all is that \"life-style change\" comes gradually and in small doses. People often are not aware that it is all too easy to set unrealistic targets or use an unhealthy alternative way of thinking or reacting to the challenge.\nThe good news for John is that, on such day, a friend will offer him a solution to his own problems. This in turn, can make an initial impact.\nThe same thing would work if John wanted help to set aside some time to get a little further away from the problem - to take care of his body as if it had been created by God for him.\nThat might involve going for a walk after work to avoid the temptation to eat too much.\nIt could also be enough that John is inspired by the way the Church has provided support for him.

You could also ask your doctors about the benefits and cost of alternatives that could fit with your lifestyle. Ask questions about your lifestyle, your health, your doctor\u2019s recommendations and how you feel when you consider a few of them.\nHealth professionals may differ in their views about the benefits of various interventions or treatments. They are also likely to differ in their opinion about their own methods of assessing the effectiveness of the intervention or treatment.\nWe know that you don\u2019t see patients in the same way that others do. So why do they sometimes think that their symptoms are different and that the treatment is different?\nIn this situation, it could be helpful to ask them if they would be receptive to what they consider is the most effective approach or a cost-efficient alternative. They might not agree to change until they feel that it is the most appropriate choice for them.\nIf those involved in planning this consultation have expressed doubts about a specific recommendation, ask them what evidence-based interventions are available to help them make the choice.\nIn this situation, it is likely that a patient has identified symptoms, treatments or diagnoses that they would not want or would regret not seeking the expert care and recommended consultations have not been organised. In these cases, it is likely that the patient\u2019s personal preference is more important than the evidence based practice guidelines, to make the medical intervention or management of the condition or condition, the patient is referring to.\nHow would you explain the patient\u2019s personal preferences and why it is important to the care that they receive?\nIf patients are willing to change their behaviour as a way of improving the quality of their care and health, they will most often be receptive to the evidence-based practice recommendation.\nFor example, if patients want to make lifestyle changes, it is possible that having worked with many other people who have made similar changes, one person might be the person they want to change. In fact, the choice for a person to change if it is related to their health is dependent on the patient\u2019s preferences.\nIn this case, one person may be more concerned and understandably more strongly than the other. On the other hand, the other person may have many experiences of not wanting to take any treatment or recommended intervention.\nAsk the patient what factors they are concerned about and how they are feeling.\nOften the patient are more aware of the reasons why they are not taking their medication as a result of concerns about whether it is necessary to have a specific intervention or a recommended alternative.\nSometimes patients may feel like there is no better way and therefore not want to change because they already have a plan or treatment. On the other hand, changes in their lifestyle are not the most important reasons for having changed their behaviour, so they may not wish they changed by themselves.\nIn this situation, the other person may be aware that the patient has had past experiences that might explain their desire to change. In this case, it may be helpful to ask them about the reasons that they might want to change.\nAsk the patient to discuss what could be an alternative to the patient\u2019s concerns and then talk about the reasons for them changing.\nThe evidence based approach can help healthcare professionals to make the most appropriate referral and referral plan for the patient. In the case below, an article published in July, 2018 by the Journal of General Internal Medicine reported 119 adverse events that the authors believed had caused harm to the patient in January, 2017. On the basis of the author\u2019s findings, the authors recommend in the following circumstances:\n- A referral to a community health nurse or community health worker (CWH) for referral to community health workers and community based services. The patient should be in a well managed setting. They need to be satisfied about the ability of the care providers to treat the symptoms of the illness and the need for the medication and follow up to ensure all necessary support has been in place. This practitioner is required to have experience in community health services.\n- The patient has been referred to their GP or other health professionals who are involved in their care and this is a contraindication to the referral to the CWH.

With health, we view how someone in our community is doing - the way they respond when they see a medical problem or see them struggling. And what do we do about health issues like hypertension that impact so much on their everyday lives?\nAt a recent national health care conference in Seattle, California, in November 2016, at the invitation of Health Canada, there was the suggestion that health could be seen from the perspective of health justice. The challenge was identified as creating more equitable resources in health care and a more holistic approach to promoting health.\nThe discussion and debate I am writing from and seeing in this blog post is one that I believe fits with and supports health justice. Health justice recognizes and addresses inequalities in access to health care and our health systems based on identity and gender. Gender-based, intersectionality, which recognizes that multiple social determinants impact health and access to care, is central to health justice.\nThe goal of gender-based health inequities is to reach our health equity goal by creating and advancing systems to provide equitable access to health care. It is a complex issue, but here are two key ways in which I think we can begin using gender-based health justice to promote health equity. One is through creating policies that promote and/or enable equity, and the other through building awareness and raising community knowledge to advocate for health equity.\nLet's start by addressing the inequity in access to health care. In America, health insurance is a fairly well known and widely studied institution. Access to health care varies widely in relation to race, ethnicity, gender-based identity, and geography. And there are many health insurers, and also many organizations and programs that have made huge efforts to advance health equity.\nOne of these organizations is the Affordable Care Act. Before the law was enacted, there were many more policies, or programs, that could better meet the needs of some groups in our communities than providing health insurance through our current public health insurance plans alone. But these policies, policies that are known and well-studied, have created more inequity in access to health care. One of the key policy changes, for instance, has been reauthorizing HMO-PPO regulations and reforming certain programs. These changes have helped to expand access, but they have excluded women from coverage and access. When we have a single health care model including the needs of women, we're better able to reach women and provide better health care.\nSo I would start by being familiar with the policies that are affecting women and those that are not. There are many examples of women not being covered by coverage policies, or health insurance, or PPOs, policies that I believe are inequitable in access to health care for women. I would start to look at the policies that are in place and work with community members, to learn about women-oriented health policies. And then to work with these policies to remove the inequity and provide equal access to health care, to make sure that health needs of women are taken into consideration on those policies.\nAs a women, you're a group, you may not be a top executive, you may not be a part of the decision making process, but your health is important to your family, your community and your health equity. You are a part of our community and our health as a whole. So as an organization that provides care to women, and to all women, you are a part of the health equity. I would start our discussion this way, and move away from the policy process and toward building knowledge and empowerment of all women about health equity, from the community perspective.\nAnd then, to have a stronger relationship with the communities we serve, to have these better health for all women.\nSo you might be asking - how can we build a stronger community with the resources and understanding to advocate for health equity? Well, there are lots of organizations that are in the works to make health equity for women a priority. We support a number of groups that are providing critical data, resources and tools that are important to building health equity, for example.\nAnd there are organizations that have helped to develop resources that can help women and their families make positive health decisions through an advocate's perspective. One of these organizations is the Women's Equality Fund. They support a number of local women health care organizations, including some that provide health insurance. The Fund supports the policy work and advocacy that the Fund supports, and provides important tools to help communities, particularly in underserved communities, improve", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\n\n## 2 Responses to \"An update on the NICE guidance\"\n\n1.

My son was diagnosed earlier than 15 years ago when he was in his late twenties. Years ago he was treated with a very poor diet, high fat diet, alcohol and I didn\u2019t do very well in my diabetes and my son probably would have been fine, now he is very overweight that has caused many organ failure. I am a strong believer that a healthy nutrition plan is the best way to ensure he won\u2019t develop diabetes or have diabetes complications. I really love his success in treating his diabetes that has caused his death. Thank you.\n\nThe thing is that we know that it depends on the individual age, overall weight and the age range. My son was just born with gestational diabetes, he had to have an injection of insulin. I have diabetes for the rest of his life (although no, I don\u2019t have diabetes, I have just been given the gift of diabetes prevention). I have to stress this out but, I don\u2019t want you to be going down the wrong path, so tell your children not to give your kids this. I am going to go back to my diet and let your children make this decision (hopefully, they don\u2019t turn out like I did).

These are associated with an increased risk of stroke, although the true risk is small in people without other cardiovascular disease.\nHypophosphatemia also known as metabolic acidosis which occurs in patients on corticosteroids and calcium antagonists. This makes the sodium and potassium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the muscle contract violently, causing a life threatening hypercarbia. If the patient is on a diuretic-type therapy, hypophosphatemia can develop.\nHypothyroidism is an under-regulation of the thyroid gland that leads to a decreased amount of triiodothyronine (T3)-thyroid hormone, the hormone most commonly associated with hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism is usually a result of non-cancerous cancer (lithumadenoma) as a cause.\nLow calcium levels in the saliva may be indicative of a parathyroid adenoma with increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) production, which causes hypercalcemia when it is elevated to a clinically significant level.\nA normal adult salivary PTH level should be < 0.33mg/L, an elevation above 0.33mg/L warrants a doctor's evaluation since this would warrant further evaluation.\nElderly adults with diabetes, are at increased risk of renal failure and stroke.\nAn increase in blood glucose from a glucose intolerance is also thought to increase the risk of strokes, but this benefit is only seen in the elderly or in those with severe hypoglycemia (Hypoglycemia)\nHigh cholesterol can cause increased coronary artery calcium in the heart's heart muscle.\nHow can I test my cholesterol?\nMany things can cause our cholesterol level to become very high or low.

It is also helpful to talk to your doctor regularly to keep track of how low your cholesterol levels are and when they really need to be examined.", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\n3.

(In the old age people have to consult the expert as it will take a month to check their pulse).\nPlease note that the above points should only be mentioned for this purpose.\nIt is important to note that, based on their actual profile, in relation to heart attack and myocardial infarction (heart attack) etc a PICC line is not the only or only option to treat patients. Many heart attack patients still have the traditional open heart surgery and therefore only the traditional coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) for treating heart attacks is recommended, which only results in the re-operation of the heart. Even with open coronary artery bypass graft in cases which have proven to have no pre-existing damage, as these patients have to have the coronary artery bypass graft for the rest of their lives, this surgery is often not done due to certain reasons such because of risk of bleeding, there is a high infection risk, there is a need for an open surgery, there is a risk to other organs etc.\nIt should be noted that, even in heart attack patients who have already had heart bypass surgery, they still have the traditional coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), which is not recommended, although it is rarely the first line of treatment for coronary heart disease patients. CABG is recommended for patients who have had coronary bypass surgery and for patients who already have existing heart blockage.\nFor patients with already existing heart blockage - after the surgery, the bypass graft is usually left to heal - CABG without any prior cardiac rehabilitation is also not recommended. In this case an open heart surgery may not be performed even if the doctor says he is done.\nThe current patient population of heart attack patients with already existing coronary artery blockage has only slightly increased for a few years - at least that is my experience as a cardiac surgeon. Even within these populations that have already had heart bypass surgery (CABG), the surgery may not still be performed if the pre-existing myocardial infarction (heart attack) is not reversible.\nThat's why I think it's time to increase the number of heart attack patients with existing coronary artery bypass (CABG) who are ready to be treated with open heart surgery, before it's too late.\nWhat should I do in any crisis like a heart attack or when I need to call an ambulance?\nFirst, inform the ambulance personnel which are being called, to whom the patient is calling the ambulance, and to which person should it be carried on. The first thing you should keep in mind in this case would be that you probably don't have a cardiac rhythm, which would be the most urgent and important thing to notify the ambulance personnel at once.\nSecond, when the ambulance is called, give the patient a proper and full medical history, including the presence of medical conditions that could complicate cardiac resuscitation in the long run. If you are in this situation, the primary doctor should call up the emergency department, to have the patient's condition assessed at the time of arrival and be prepared to address the patient's issue.\n(A special situation arises if the patient is in intensive care after a heart attack, if the patient's heart has collapsed, if the patient has died, and if the heart isn't receiving proper care).\nFinally, the same thing should be said to the ambulance personnel who are already calling in the ambulance.\nTo sum up, it is essential to tell the ambulance personnel and the patient the patient's emergency, and the time to the hospital and your priority, and immediately inform the ambulance personnel and the patient, and then make a call to the ER personnel.", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\n\nI have been working on my own cardiology for about a year to create a risk profile of the candidate. It makes sense to me to create the profile because the risk of CVD has nothing about me!\n\nYou've answered my initial question, and I've tried to make sense of your profile and have found it useful. This is the part of the profile I'm most concerned about: the 5-year survival rate. The 5-year mortality rate is a very important metric and represents how often the CVD patient dies in that year - the 5-year survival rate of a patient who has CVD is the number of patients in that year who die of CVD. The mortality rate, of course, is the number of patients in a particular year out of the total number of patients enrolled.\n\nThis is about 80% of the 5-year survival rates in your profile. The 5-year survival rate tells us about the probability of survival at some point after the first year of CVD diagnosis and up to a year after that. Thus, we see that, in my profile, the 5-year survival rate is about 74%! My confidence in those figures is high, since the mortality rate is also going to be high. It is also a fair representation of what it would take to keep a patient alive a year after his diagnosis until 80% of the patients survive as CVD patients. (My risk of surviving to age 80, if he ever survives, is at least about 800 per unit of risk.)\n\nBut when you get to the point you've got to talk about the average risk of a person dying of CVD before 5 years - the 800th unit of risk that you can't predict. You have to think: when and how do you account for the individual risk of dying of CVD before this 800 th death? The risk of dying of CVD before 100 deaths is about 32 per unit, while it is 46 for any death that has CVD. So each month, this person will give you one unit of risk. (Here's an example: a 90-year old male aged 55 comes for his annual cholesterol test and shows signs of being at medium risk: systolic 120-125 and diastolic 80-85, which is a level he can reasonably expect over the course of the next 10 years).\n\nNow, the point of having this risk profile is to give you a value of your risk of dying from CVD on a per year basis - how bad the risk of the 100th patient is compared to all the people in your population. (Let's say you're 50, and here we have 275 cases over the course of 20 years, 800 out of the 1000. Let's say you're 60, and at 50, there's no risk of death. I might say 800 out of the 1000 is risk, and let's say 500 out of the 275 is risk.) Here's how the 32 and the 46 are calculated.\n\nSo if this person came for an annual cholesterol test and had a risk of 46, the risk of dying of CVD after 800 years is 32, and his chance of survival after 800 years on the risk score of 46 is 58/1000 = 67.67%.\n\nThis sounds great, doesn't it?\n\nThis makes sense. So what we have here is a nice way of looking at if the person is at low risk and low after a fairly long period of time. It would take a doctor a century to notice that the risk of CVD goes through the roof in about half of the cases (or rather the average of about half the cases).\n\nThe idea is that we need to go forward knowing we have better information about the person's risk of death after a period of time. However, that information is not given to us in such detail within the profile. We don't know how large the risk gets until we run a 5-year retrospective analysis and we can see if it drops off to about 16 per year.\n\nSo, the profile seems pretty reasonable to me! If you are a primary care physician reading this, you might", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\n\nThis is where I can see things going badly wrong. I have always argued with your idea for a generic algorithm to reduce the effect of blood pressure from 125-130 mmHg to 85-90 mmHg.\n\nNow your data is much too old to fit into the age based, population based model you're using. You also have a BMI over 33/25. I guess your data is from the middle-middle age population with a high incidence of DM, and you have a low mean blood pressure.\n\nYour idea fits well with that and the one that we use for the population based disease modeling, but it's not your idea that I am aware of.\n\nSo, it seems like someone else could do it better I think.\n\nAs long as you're assuming this is one of the things that affects your own blood pressure, it's not going to matter.\n\nA lot of people don't have trouble with this issue, but I'll try to do it a bit harder.\n\nFor your age-based model, I would use a model where the age variable is between 50-60 (if you're seeing your blood pressure from the 50th to the 60th percentile).\n\nThere is one problem with that, though: because the age is one dimension in the model, you aren't really comparing whether your blood pressure is 30/19.4, or 41/14 mm Hg, because it's 100 (rather than 30) here. Also, a person with a BMI around 14 is much more likely to have elevated (hypertensive) blood pressure than somebody with a BMI under 14 (the normal 15 to 25th percentile for age is pretty much the same for men and women - that's why you see men with higher blood pressure and women with less).\n\nSo my takeaway: if you're wanting to model someone's blood pressure, it's important to include age in that.\n\nAs for the age-based model you've chosen to use, well, you need to have a simple model that doesn't miss your age altogether, so you need to assume everything else will go well. For this, I would choose a model with 1 degree interval around the 15th, 30th, and 45th percentile, like the BMI-BP model. I don't quite understand why you think this is the right way, because the BMI-BP model is an over-dispersion model, which is a better model than only 50 percent above and 50 percent below the 30th percentile.\n\nFinally, I would use an age based time-based age-driven model, like the model that was used in the previous question. This will make an even more accurate model, as it fits better on the basis of your age rather than your age.\n\nAlso, I would choose a more accurate model when you have a low mean age, and a less accurate one when you have a moderate age.\n\nI am sure that you have some work to do before making any of these decisions.\n\nI'm not really sure what your final answer is, but I believe you should think about how this could be explained. For example, you could write a new function with the same name as this one. If you use it, how would it work with the others?\n\nEdit 2: I believe I had an error on the second line that needs fixing.\n\n\u2022 Thank you for your answer. Now I'm trying to get the best results for my question. I'm not sure if this is an age based agebased model which is to be used I guess I can think of a more appropriate age based (like 38 at age 68 or 36 at 29.5) model I can use to put the new model with it. Also, I need to add that the age-based model should be more accurate than I used in my previous question when I was using a model with 100-300 points. Also, I know I need to be aware of the problem about this age based model that is that the result is worse. So, I will re-think what this model is based on. Thanks for your help.

The recommendations from NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) suggest that people aged 30 years or older should be tested for heart disease. They recommend that people aged 30 years are tested for diabetes, high cholesterol, coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. These measurements help healthcare professionals understand the overall risk of cardiovascular disease and develop effective prevention strategies.\nWhat is the goal of the NICE guidelines?\nThe NICE guidelines emphasize the importance of screening for heart disease risk factors in people aged 30 years or older. These risk factors include high blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes, and a family history of heart disease. Screening provides the opportunity for early detection and management of these conditions, ultimately reducing the risk of future cardiovascular events.\nThe recommended screening test for cardiovascular disease risk assessment includes measuring:\n\u25cf Total Cholesterol: Ideally, healthcare professionals measure total cholesterol using a 120kPa sphygmomanometer cuff. This measurement indicates the overall level of cholesterol in the body, which can help determine the risk of heart disease. Ideally, healthcare professionals adjust the measurements to a normal range (0-80) as indicated by NICE guidelines.\n\u25cf Triglyceride Level: Another possible cardiac risk factor is triglycerides, commonly measured by meters. This measurement indicates the amount of fat in the blood that can act as a marker of heart disease risk. High triglycerides can raise the risk of heart disease, so healthcare professionals typically monitor triglycerides to determine the need for further testing.\n\u25cf Total LDL Cholesterol Level: LDL cholesterol, known as bad cholesterol, is considered high in this type of risk factor, as high LDL cholesterol levels can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\u25cf HDL Cholesterol Concentration: A higher level of HDL cholesterol indicates higher-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which aids in maintaining good heart health. This measurement also helps identify the individuals with the lowest LDL cholesterol levels.\n\u25cf Fasting Blood Glucose Level: Monitoring fasting blood glucose level is particularly important for individuals whose blood glucose levels remain persistently high. It is crucial to regularly measure fasting glucose levels to diagnose any potential cardiovascular complications as well as to assess if the patient requires further testing.\nHow often should a person be tested for cardiovascular disease risk?\nRegular and thorough cardiovascular disease risk assessment is crucial for individuals aged 40 or older. It is recommended that healthcare professionals follow these guidelines to maintain the best possible cardiovascular health:\n\u25cf Screening for Cardiovascular Disease Risk: Regular screening for cardiovascular disease risk is important to detect high blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and diabetes in people aged 45 years or older. Healthcare professionals assess these cardiovascular risk factors as part of an overall health evaluation.\n\u25cf Follow-up Follow-Up: Regular follow-up appointments and regular follow-ups with healthcare professionals are important for evaluating blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and diabetes levels over time. Regular appointments allow the healthcare team to track the progress and adjust prevention strategies as needed.\n\u25cf Evaluate Smoking: Smoking is a known risk factor for heart disease. Healthcare professionals use questionnaires to check for smoking in people aged 40 or older. This evaluation can help assess the presence and severity of smoking-related health problems or changes over time.\n\u25cf Use of EKG: EKG (Electrocardiogram) is an important standard for evaluating heart function and detecting changes in heart rhythms. Healthcare professionals use this test frequently to track heart rhythms and detect abnormal cardiac patterns.\n\u25cf Use of CPT Code: For medical procedures involving instruments or devices, healthcare professionals use the correct clinical procedure code. The correct code for an invasive procedure, for example, a cardiac biopsy, must be obtained after proper documentation with proper reference codes.\nBy following these guidelines, healthcare professionals can assess and monitor cardiovascular health over time and inform appropriate preventive strategies. The results of the tests play a vital role in identifying and addressing potential complications related to heart disease, including CVD risk assessment and diagnosis.\nFitness guidelines for heart disease patients\nWhen it comes to living a healthy life, cardiovascular disease (CF) risk assessment is important regardless of age. According to the American College of Sports Med, more than 70% of all CF patients will experience at least one cardiovascular event within the next 10 years.\nTo help individuals living with CF maintain their health, this course is designed to teach cardiovascular risk assessment. This course is intended for those individuals", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\nJING, 70, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure 114/61 mmHg, has recently lost weight and had a history of high cholesterol, had one diagnosed with coronary artery disease, the doctor was told by her physician to take cholesterol-lowering drugs and to maintain her weight.

A good strategy is to focus on adding more physical activity on one day, then adding more physical activity to the next day. This is especially more time-effective for people who don\u2019t have lots of time to exercise.\n- Consider setting up healthy eating and physical activity goals that incorporate each activity for the week (e.g. eat breakfast on Monday, keep walking for one hour on Tuesday, eat lunch and snack on another day, take a walk on Friday).\n- Eat a lot of vegetables and fruits, and decrease consumption of added sugars (see the last section of this video).\n- Increase the amount of protein (meat, fish, tofu, cheese, low-fat dairy) you are eating (see the last section of this video).\n- Get enough vitamin D (1,000 to 2,000 IU daily).\n- Exercise daily at a level that is comfortable for you. The guidelines in this video show how hard to exercise.\n- Quit smoking (100-250 mg lead per day for those who have not smoked.) If using a cigarette, stop smoking completely (ideally) within 18 months.\n- Drink less alcohol (and higher quality alcohol) and more water (particularly at night).\n- Eat meals instead of eating fast foods and snacks. Eating food in smaller portions can help you maintain a weight loss goal.\n- If you smoke, quit.\n- Reduce or quit alcohol consumption. Research suggests that drinking excessive amounts of alcohol can result in adverse health effects as well as obesity, and the increased risk of nonalcoholic liver disease. If you are currently drinking alcohol, this could help you reach or surpass your weight loss goal.\n- Reduce stress when possible (with no physical activity on high-use weekends)\n- Get adequate sleep\n- Be active throughout the day (a few hours of physical activity per day throughout the day), and reduce times when you are not active as well.\n- See which physical activity can be done without equipment.

The previous advice to quit smoking was in 2007. Then, in 2014, the guidance on CVD prevention was replaced with the advice about cardiovascular prevention and treatment that came along with the NICE guidelines to improve care and patient outcomes after the devastating heart attack.\nThere is an urgent need for new standards of practice in this area. The NICE advice to improve the care of patients with coronary heart disease is particularly important. We need the evidence that it is worthwhile and worth paying attention to. The NICE guidelines to improve the care of patients by coronary heart disease for those diagnosed with these diseases are relevant to patients with these diseases and need recommendations. However, we can recommend more specific recommendations based on our knowledge of the available research.\nWe often have to live with false assumptions and assumptions. They are an important part of medicine.\nThe most common type of false belief is that a person should keep an ideal body weight. This is also false in some situations. People should keep a healthy diet and take steps to keep their blood pressure, heart rate, blood cholesterol and other factors normal through dietary habits and physical activity.\nIn certain situations, we should not think so and take action. However, this does not mean that we should not take risks. For instance, you eat certain foods and you start losing weight without changing habits. It is not correct. The above-mentioned advice on heart attack should not be assumed for people with cardiovascular disease.\nWhen we consider that no-one needs to see an oncologist or oncologist to treat diseases such as cancer, we are still asked, \"If I do not see an oncologist, what are you doing to keep yourself healthy and safe?\" This is one of the key aspects of health professionals in this country: we should stay at the point where we cannot see a doctor in terms of any part of physical activity or nutrition. What do we have to do?\nSo we should take steps to keep ourselves healthy. When we do not see anyone, we should stop. People become afraid of leaving their own doctor. We can only imagine that a person will be in good shape in the future if this information is conveyed to them. It is a good rule to educate others. And of course, every profession is responsible for everyone.", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\nDr Hafiz Hasan: Well, what follows is an example of what could be considered a CVD prevention recommendation for Chinese people. What would your recommendations look like? Dr Hafiz has always been a medical consultant to a large Japanese restaurant. I was seeing his patients when they came come for coffee. Our restaurant was looking to offer a healthier menu. It didn\u2019t happen that way. In a recent clinic visit, one patient who was a 22-year-old female, gave us this message and said to me \u201cHello, do you think Chinese women should be recommended a low-cholesterol, low-fat diet instead of a low-carb diet?\u201d My reply was, \u201cThere are lots of low-carb products which we are currently not recommending because they were not formulated for China. We are recommending a low-carb diet which we are saying will lead to lower risk of heart disease in our population.\u201d He went on, \u201cI had a visit with you when I was just being treated for an ANA. I was on a low-carb regimen for 2 months after this visit and it was not the same as before, because you mentioned something that is a low-carb regime. So, it seemed at first that you were getting really good results from your regimen and that nothing would change.\u201d\nBut the problem with this idea of low-carb diet and low-cholesterol diets is that these low-carb diets work against healthy, active men and women, and you see them in the form of a protein and omega 3 fatty acids deficiency. They work by reducing the cholesterol in your cells so you get a positive message for the cardiovascular system. Chinese women are not doing anything about their cholesterol. Chinese men are not doing anything about their cholesterol. Chinese women and Chinese men are not getting anything out with healthy diets so much attention.\nSo, what we need to do is have a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines. And it would probably be wise for Chinese women and Chinese men to pay attention to it. It\u2019s a good idea to make lifestyle changes that will take the load off that cholesterol. That should be a common theme in Chinese women and men. But the Chinese diet is very rich in fatty foods and very low in fresh fruits and vegetables. It\u2019s very dry and dried and very salty. It\u2019s really bad for the cardiovascular system. So, you want to try to eat foods that are low in saturated fats and high in unsaturated fats. You\u2019ll need to eat lots of plant foods such as fruits, vegetables, oats, rice, beans, nuts. So, it needs to be a nutritious, fresh diet with plenty of whole grains to help maintain the heart in a healthy state. Chinese men should also take action and eat less salty and fried food and eat more fresh fruits and vegetables rich in antioxidants. You have to keep the high carbohydrate diet you do in China and the high fat diet you eat in the West. Those can be both a problem because they are not healthy for the heart.\nFor more information on NICE guidelines and their application to Chinese medical research, please contact:\nProfessor Dr. Berenice I.

He is over the age of 60, who has cardiovascular diseases diagnosed by the hospital after three years.\nBased on an interview and self-test done by the doctor and Dr. Jia with the patient, his target is not an ideal weight but he needs an average BMI of 28. He would need to reduce waist circumference to 52 cm. According to the study, the patient should decrease LDL cholesterol by 14% and increase HDL cholesterol by 14%. The patient also needs to exercise more, and quit smoking, and drink alcohol.\nDr. Jia would also like to examine the patient\u2019s C-reactive protein for a few days, its levels could suggest some of the other risk factors like hyper-cholesterolemia, obesity, poor nutrition, diabetes or obesity, high blood pressure in an attempt to reduce the C-reactive protein test.\nA previous research carried out by the same group of researchers found that the average total cholesterol levels in the patient are 140-160, while the best target is 152-163; after 30 years of age, they found an average increase in total cholesterol level was 16-17. A study of patients who consumed a low fat diet, showed a 25.3% increase in their overall cholesterol level, whereas it decreased to 5.4% in the patient who consumed high-fat diets and 8.0% in those who only consumed the usual diet.\nAccording to the study conducted at Jade Hospital, they have found that the average daily intake of FAT was 51.8 kcal/day and W-MU was 59.1 kcal/day, the average waist circumference was 79.6 cm, and that each one third of the total fats consumed were found to be saturated, or partially saturated. They also found out that FAT was found to be the richest fats, according to the study published in the JSCI journal, Journal of the Korean Association of Cardiology.\nThe body of fatty acids may be reduced in the body with unhealthy, fried, processed foods. Fat is stored in the body as free fatty acids and triglycerides (the body doesn\u2019t produce these acids) or as fatty acids in the liver, making up up to 25 percent of the body\u2019s energy.\nThe study concluded that the patient also needs to follow a high-fat diet from the start.\nThe study\u2019s authors have also mentioned that, their findings are accurate and, consistent with what people elsewhere have discovered: if they eat diet low in saturated fat, they may lower the risk of dying early and have improved cardiovascular risk factors such as increased cholesterol levels. Also, the study found a possible link between type of fats and how often they eat it, and that\u2019s because the fat content of high energy foods, which include meat, and animal fats, is low than that of healthy foods, which includes olive and peanut oils, avocados, and plant oils, and fatty fish such as salmon and mackerel also have few good fats.\nThere are 5 kinds of oils, and one, called the eicosanoid, is the major component and helps you to produce antioxidants like Vitamin A and C, while two, omega 3 fatty acids, are found in these 5 types of fatty oils, are a source of Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids.\nThese oils are a mixture of polyunsaturated fats and two types of long-chain omega oils with a fatty acid in between.

In the past it was associated with people wearing clothes, carrying ornaments, and other symbolic objects of social class. No longer is it a matter of personal taste, but of cultural expression. As a society we can be highly desirable and attractive, but also subconsciously seductive. Therefore, with the right diet, a healthy body-weight, and the proper amount of exercise you have the ability to look after and to achieve your ideal looks. You will be able to get your ideal looks and a great way of maintaining good health.\nSo how do we get our ideal looks and/ or a great way of maintaining good health. For some of us it\u2019s eating a healthy, balanced diet, exercising regularly, and maintaining a healthy weight, but there is another aspect to our body: A positive emotional experience. This is important because our emotional health is a huge part of our physical health. We must give ourselves a good emotional, psychological and spiritual well-being in order to stay healthy and avoid diseases.\nThere is a significant relationship between a good mental state and a good physical state. This is well illustrated through a study by John A. Seligman; he presented his book, \u201cPermanence: the Power and Science of Overcoming Chronic Stress, the Impact of the Stress-Reducing Role of Diet,\u201d in which he describes a healthy lifestyle and how it changes your mood and your physical health.\nSeligman\u2019s research is a good example of how a good body image can translate to a more positive outlook on everything and a healthier quality of life. In other words, emotional and spiritual well-being is very important because it enables us to become healthier both physically and mentally for our whole life. In the case of skin issues the connection between depression and skin irritation is very clear. It is very important to be aware of our body\u2019s condition and to be able to take action and do something about it if necessary.\nHere\u2019s a list of a few resources for us to use and help us maintain a healthy body weight and to avoid a lot of skin problems. There is an infographic I made that shows the link between the skin condition and the stress level. The infographic shows the links between skin conditions and stress levels, which may indicate that we need to change our diet if we want to address those skin conditions effectively.\nThe bottom of this blog is full of inspiring resources that can help us manage and even fight off skin problems. Check them out!\nThere are lots of great things being done in the world and within the framework of our body and what comes after. We can change the way we look, where we live, our lifestyle, and even our health. With these changes, we will look, feel, and feel the same. That being said, there are also some challenges. Some diseases can be caused by not having the right genes to develop and in some cases have been in the family for generations.\nTo address all of these challenges, we should focus on what we can do in a positive way. We need to look after ourselves and be able to deal with the problems we face when it comes to our body. This does not happen automatically, but by practicing good habits, taking care of ourselves and being healthy, our overall well-being and our skin becomes significantly better.\nAll these things are connected to a healthy emotional and spiritual well-being and their relation to health, but that\u2019s all for now.

And we would need to update our risk calculations for ourselves based on the revised results.\nOnce we had these controls on our hands, we would be able to start developing a recommendation for our participants based on the results.

These patients are then referred to an adult-specialist group that meets with the patients relatives or is referred their family physician to obtain a risk evaluation of the patient based on the renal risk assessment.\nPatients that have a family history of CKD, especially those with CKD risk are then referred to a health care professional who has undergone an advanced screening procedure for CKD based on the patient's family history using the NICE guideline.\nThe National Centre for Chronic Disease Prevention & Public Health recommends screening for CKD at an earlier age for patients with a family history of CKD:\n- Individuals with a family history of CKD who present before or after 55 years of age may be screened using a validated CKD Risk Screening Program (CRSP). (See Chart B-1)\n- A combination of CRSP and HICR(R) can be used if more than one CKD risk factor is present for a patient with an average age of 55 years and less than 10 or more than 45 years of age.\n- An alternate test to screen for CKD and identify potential risk for subsequent CKD may involve a two-step CMP that is referred to the patient's physician and then repeated to the primary care provider. This can also be done with a one-step CMP or a two-step CMP (see Chart B-2). A CMP is referred to the primary care provider for appropriate follow up if needed without a second test. If the patient is eligible for a CMP, then a secondary test that is typically performed is the CRUP (Cochlear Resuscitation Program).\nThe second step to the patient's CMP screening is typically used for patients who have a family history of CKD or a greater risk for future CKD. If the patient attends the regular appointments required by the CRSP and CMP, then the CCHP is then referred to the patient's primary care provider to conduct another examination or perform further tests on the patient to screen for CKD or possible future CKD.\nIn cases where there is no indication for screening for CKD and no other testing is required for patients, then the primary care physician will refer the patient for a CMP based on the patient's family history, whether risk factors are present, and whether the patient has advanced CKD risk factors.\nPatients who have family members with either CKD or CKD risk factors are also considered to have the highest risk for advancing to the next-highest risk group of patients.\nIn addition to risk factors, there are also a number of known risk factors for progressing to the next-highest risk category based on the patient's age, sex, ethnicity, comorbid conditions, and whether patients have an advanced CKD risk status.\n- 76% of patients with CKD risk factors will progress to the next-highest risk category based on risk factors (76.", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\nDr. Cao said that the guidelines would be based mainly on the population studies of Chinese, in particular, those who have an elevated BMI (1.0-2.5 mm, with elevated cholesterol levels), with an increase in life expectancy. He added that the guidelines would be based on the results of the studies that used people who smoked as a control group. The guidelines would have 16 specific recommendations, not only about the prevention of CVD, but also about the monitoring of the response of the cardiovascular system in real life situations, with which the current guidelines would have to be interpreted. Dr. Cao added that this would have to be done based on an expert review of available data, preferably by epidemiologists, because the guidelines will not have to be implemented, but could only be adopted by experts to the best of their ability.\nThe guidelines would also be based on the results of a large scale study that focused on the general population of the country and tested to what degree high cholesterol can be controlled by diet, exercise, drugs, and possibly some physical exercise training. Professor Yingliang Li, an expert expert in the cardiovascular system, explained that the guideline would also be based on the evaluation of the prevalence of the disease in the population of China, which is usually done by the CDC.\nThe group of experts in cardiovascular diseases, including those of Professor Yingliang Li, President of the China National Committee for Basic and Clinical Medicine, said that the recommendation would also apply to the evaluation of the results of various studies in patients with high cholesterol. Professor Li said that while it is essential to know the degree of this disease, the most suitable method will depend on various clinical characteristics, such as the individual clinical characteristics of each patient, including the risk factor list and the risk value, its value for the study and the risk factor for subsequent treatment, while also adapting it to the treatment and risk factors. The study has to take into account the genetic and environmental factors of the patient, as well as any comorbidities, to provide appropriate guidelines. Professor Yingliang Li added that the recommendations of the guidelines would be based by using a study in Chinese to develop clinical guidelines for patients with high cholesterol.\nProfessor Lianxu Jiang, director of the University of Beijing\u2019s Centre for Cardiovascular Research and Epidemiology and an expert in the management of heart conditions, said that most recent studies have shown that high blood cholesterol levels in the general population and patients with heart conditions may lead to many negative consequences, including an increased risk of death and complications.\nAccording to Professor Jiang, the study on the disease of the Chinese population with high cholesterol, including a large and rigorous analysis of data, has already been done in China. Professor Jiang added that the study aims to determine whether these recommendations are supported by the clinical evidence in large-scale studies. He did not elaborate on the study or any of the results.\nProfessor Li added that the guidelines will be based on the results of a larger study that showed that there are no clear correlations between high cholesterol and any cardiovascular system complication in people with high level of blood cholesterol and high fat intake.", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\nA very short answer, of course. The National Health and Family Planning Commission recommends a minimum four-point scale for the screening of cardiovascular risk markers (Hgb or HbA1c), and the most appropriate screening interval will be set out in the guidelines. Other groups in Hong Kong have recommended that women, pregnant and lactating women and those with underlying CVDs should be routinely screened for CVD (CVD risk factors) with the NHS screening test for CVD. There are also guidelines to prevent CVD on multiple levels (including physical activity), diet and tobacco use.\nAnother important health indicator that needs to be addressed is the cardiovascular risk factor profile of the individual, and they should be assessed on the whole, even if other factors are taken into account, such as lifestyle risk factors (smoking, diabetes, obesity) or other cardiovascular risk factors. For example, hypertension or high blood pressure is a risk factor for CVD, so it would be important for them to be assessed as part of their physical examination as part of health screening.\nAn evaluation of the results of health screening in terms of the value it places on people, and whether it can be used to target those who are at risk of CVD but who don\u2019t meet the criteria for CVD. To summarise, we generally think of CVD as a condition where the rate of heart disease or stroke is increasing over the years and there\u2019s no single, \u2018right\u2019 way to get there. It\u2019s quite reasonable to set goals for reducing the frequency and severity of CVDs, as well as reducing the risk of developing an existing one, or preventing the onset of one.\nFor example, it\u2019s reasonable to establish that if you have a heart attack or stroke at a young age, you can slow down and prevent another from happening, or if you are at risk of coronary heart disease, have regular blood pressure, cholesterol and blood pressure tests for CVD. If you are at the older and more developed stages of CVD, then it would be useful to discuss with your family physician what type of screening tests you need, what the frequency of screening, and what the results do suggest.\nThat said, there is a range of lifestyle factors that can affect your risk of developing a disease if it has become chronic for you. For example, smoking, poor diet and body weight (obesity). If these or a number of other lifestyle factors impact on your health, such as having a sedentary lifestyle, inadequate social support, lack of exercise or poor nutrition, you might need to make some adjustments if or when it\u2019s reasonable to do so for your own health rather than for your friend, partner or family member. For example, if your friend or partner needs to get out in the community, you could ask her to go for a walk, join a gym or find out about fitness classes or exercise venues nearby. Sometimes, having support from a coach or a health professional can also be very beneficial. You also might want to discuss ways to reduce the amount of stress you are under, for example talking to a trusted friend or family member.\nAlthough, for most of us, it\u2019s not likely to be an issue, but in the case of people who have a family history of CVD or you are a smoker, whether you are currently or have just recently quit smoking, it might be a good idea to discuss these risks with your GP or with an expert in CVD from a professional with a specialist interest in CVD.\nIt\u2019s great that they are going to help to inform you about that. But we also wanted to point out the things they don\u2019t cover, and that is the importance of talking to people about it themselves, so, you should talk to a doctor if you have a condition which impacts on your cardiovascular health. The GP might be a good place to start if you think you\u2019re experiencing any issues with your heart, or if you aren\u2019t feeling good - it is extremely rare for people with a condition to go to the GP with just any issue, but if you\u2019re just having any symptoms, it\u2019ll provide good guidance and information. It\u2019ll also give you guidance on any medicines you\u2019re taking that might impact your health, and may, for example, prescribe some lifestyle changes.\nAlthough this is just one in a list that can cover many topics, there are lots of things which fall under these sections. They can be discussed at length for example, and it might be worth looking at the NHS guidelines for CVD and heart problems (National Health and Family Planning Commission, 2013).

They have been receiving annual screenings for type 2 diabetes since 2018. They have been following a heart-healthy lifestyle including decreasing their alcohol intake, adding daily exercise into their usual routine, exercising at least 150 minutes per week and having a P. T2D blood sugar screening that was completed in 2015, in 2016. They also have an annual physical examination. The next meeting with their doctor will be in 1 year from their 2020 doctor's visit. Then we would like to see how things in their lives have changed since then.\nCan you explain any specific heart health recommendations, anything specific about CVD?\nOur research has shown that for any of us with a BMI between 25 to 29, if we are not overweight, there is a benefit in reducing the risk of a cardiovascular event for almost any type of diabetes mellitus by 30%, and the risk of having a cardiac event by 40%. I have never heard anyone in their life group talk about being healthy if they aren't physically active. What could be in the person's daily routine?\nSome heart health recommendations for the individual, depending on age, whether they have physical activity or are sedentary, are to get 30-60 minutes of moderate (50% of your max heart rate) moderate aerobic activity a day followed by 30-60 minutes of moderately intense cardio, or strength training, to maintain overall health. This could include doing house exercises, biking, yoga, jogging or dancing.\nI have seen this on the TV as well. When we are eating out, we rarely eat out, but most restaurants offer a variety of options for healthy food. What can you recommend for the individual who may struggle with consuming some of these other types of food?\nWhen I read, \"I'm a 52 year old male with hypertension that is not well controlled and I'm starting to be worried that I'm overdoing it\", my doctor suggested taking one drug at a time and trying a new supplement, such as an omega 3 fatty acid supplement. I have not had any side-effects so my doctor recommended 30 days of omega 3 supplements and started taking a daily dose of 5,000 mg. However I think it might be better to start by taking the low dose 5,000 mg daily and to keep increasing over the course of the month to around a 2g dose. The high dose can help to increase the concentration of other vitamins in the body, but the side-effects are quite tolerable. We would add 2g daily to the 5,000mg per day to see if that would give us the full benefit but we need to discuss this with our doctor.\nWill I need to change my diet this month as my blood pressure is rising fast and I'm having symptoms? If so, it would be best to see Dr. Reiter for more details, she would be most grateful, what are your next steps?\nThere are a few reasons why you might need to make a change to your diet. First of all, there are some foods that have been shown to increase the risk of heart disease. Red meat, for example is one of these foods that can cause heart disease, but there's also a lot of other types of cholesterol, so it's best to start with plant-based protein instead. I would also suggest cutting out all added sugars.\nSecond, your exercise routine will probably be more difficult than I should be doing, and I think it's important to have other forms of exercise as well, so exercise in different kinds of environments can help. We may need to talk about our exercise outside to see if that makes a difference, but I like to exercise at the same time on Sunday afternoons, so that we can get out together", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be? A: 'Exercise six days a week, at least three times a week (with the goal of 20 minutes), and do not smoke or drink alcohol', as outlined in the NICE guide, and with the NHS Heart Foundation guidelines for heart disease (published in 2015) and the NHS's Heart Health Advice (2017).\nYou can find a lot more information about the NHS CVD Heart Guide here, but you can also find out more about lifestyle measures for the different risk groups on our other blogs about how exercise and diet affect your risk of developing diabetes.\nWhat else can you do to reduce your risk of heart disease?\nYou might be able to manage your risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) by eating a healthy diet. A low SBP/DBP (blood pressure level) and low ejection fraction (EF) is vital for preventing sudden cardiac death. We should be asking people in most cases of cardiac disease to eat a diet rich in whole, fresh plant foods and lower in refined foods and added sugars. However, people with a heart condition should also be aware that there are nutritional implications. For example, the cholesterol in a fat-free diet has been shown to significantly increase the risk of coronary heart disease and other vascular problems (including hardening of the arteries, angina, stroke and heart failure) compared to those who were eating a diet rich in complex carbohydrates. However, diet in this way may also cause weight gain, which makes these people more likely to be obese.\nAnother important consideration is a high level of protein intake which is associated with lowering the risk of cardiovascular problems and possibly of developing diabetes as well. That does not mean that protein free diets need to be avoided or severely restricted, but they should be accompanied with regular exercise to maintain and improve the quality of a protein-rich diet.\nThere are also lifestyle measures that can help to reduce the time spent sitting, which are linked to a higher risk of CVD (cardiovascular disease including angina - chest pain or breathlessness). The idea behind these is that by moving around as much as possible a few hours per day - in the sitting area (on the table or in your car), or during the lunch time whilst carrying your family - can help increase your physical activity level. There are lots of walking techniques out on the beach, swimming competitions, and jogging through your town."], "7": ["Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?\nThe first guideline is known as the 'Pre-Heart Failure Lifestyle Risk Questionnaire (PHLFFR)' which identifies risk factors. Since there is a strong correlation between lifestyle and risk of heart failure that the PHLFFR can also be used in heart failure classification, you might want to ask your general practitioner. Then the PHLFFR is another risk factor that is not included in the overall criteria. For a heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, the PHLFFR would be included in this category.\nThe second guideline is the American Heart Association's (AHA/ACC) 2015 Consensus on the definition and management of hyperlipidemic heart failure, which has some relevance to cardiovascular health and includes CVD (cardiovascular) risk, as well as those heart failure patients who are having a history of cardiovascular disease, such as a history of myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease.\nIt is important to note that the AHA/ACC guidelines do not prescribe medications to reduce high cholesterol, but rather highlight the need for lifestyle modifications.\nYour general practitioner, in consultation with your primary care doctor, should diagnose patients with CVD, and provide further guidance in your heart failure management.\nA high cholesterol level can have numerous causes, including:\n- Poor dietary habits\n- Poor management of any other underlying health conditions, including diabetes\n- Family history of heart disease and/or clogged arteries\n- Obesity (or having additional health problems, such as raised cholesterol)", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?\nCVD risk factors:\nThe NICE guideline:\nThe most important cause of death in patients under 75 years or in patients who were above the age of 75 years, except for chronic heart failure and the most common of the risk factors for CVD:\n- Long-term tobacco smoking \u2014 smokers have a 30 per cent greater risk of CVD compared to non-smokers. Long-term smoking causes vascular and non-vital inflammation in the endothelium, which leads to impaired endothelial function.\n- High blood pressure and blood lipids \u2014 hypertension increases risk of CVD. Diets that emphasize the consumption of fruits, vegetables, fruits and wholegrains, and limit saturated fat intake may reduce cholesterol levels.\n- Unhealthy lifestyle \u2014 regular physical activity, maintaining social contact, eating balanced, nutrient-rich food, and avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption may help lower risk. The recommendation is that, with no limitation, people with a history of CVD risk should discuss their lifestyle and health to their family doctor.\n- Healthy habits\u2014 the most important thing is to keep weight under control if you are overweight, control cholesterol levels and lipids with healthy food and lifestyle, get vaccinated against the flu, and regularly check blood pressure at home.\n- Smoking cessation \u2014 it is recommended that a person quit smoking and do regular exercise, eat a healthy and balanced diet, and limit alcohol consumption.\n- Screening for cardiovascular disease\n- Take medication if needed\nPrevention tips you should consider:\nA 2016 study on cardiovascular prevention concluded that those who are physically active from 12 to 60 km on a weekly basis have a 16 per cent greater risk of cardiovascular disease than the average person who exercises regularly.\nPhysical activity in the form of a walking club can prevent cardiovascular complications and is a great tool to reduce the risks of several diseases.\nFor people in or around risk groups and the elderly, regular physical activity is recommended. Adults with risk factors should also make an effort to exercise, and follow a health guideline about exercise based on the risk.\nExercise to reduce cardiovascular disease risk:\n- Start from the bottom up: 5-10 minutes of moderate to intense aerobic activity for children, as young as 12 to 13 years of age if possible and an activity that would be fun and involve lots of physical activity. Children and teenagers aged 14-18 are less active and can benefit from group classes that mix activities that are easy, with a goal to achieve a challenge.\n- 10-minute sessions that include 10 or more exercises per day for adults: 45 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity. This can be fun exercise and involve lots of muscle and joint strengthening activities in addition to aerobic activities. The activities used in this exercise regime should be aerobic in nature in terms of heart rate and breathing.\nThe American Heart Association states the risk of developing heart disease increases with age. The elderly who have heart disease are at an increased risk, but their heart disease progression is accelerated by smoking and elevated blood pressure. The risk is similar for younger individuals, but the cardiovascular risk is also increased for those who abuse alcohol.\n- For people with existing heart disease or previous myocardial infarction, the recommendations for individuals who have had a heart attack (defined as the first myocardial infarction with a fatal outcome) should be as follows:\n- Limit physical activity: 45 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity during the day, especially with little or no additional intensity. This is considered moderate strength, or body weight training, for those with limited control of their weight.\n- Control blood pressure: Blood pressure should be controlled according to the International Hypertension and Cholesterol Guidelines that have been updated by the World Health Organization. Individuals with cardiovascular disease (i.e., high cholesterol) and other systemic conditions often have high blood pressure, so they do not need treatment to control the high blood pressure.\n- Limit diet and physical activity: The recommended amount of alcohol should be restricted.\nFor those with heart disease:\n- Moderate aerobic activity: 45 minutes, at least three times per week. Aim for this to be moderate and to incorporate some moderate physical activity of about 25 minutes at a time as well.\n- Avoid smoking: Do not smoke.\n- Control blood sugar: Control your blood glucose and blood pressure.\n- Check blood pressure regularly \u2014 if your BP or your systolic/diastolic (the ratio) is over 140/90 or within 128/89 mmHg, then you may", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?\n\n#### Expert Answer\n\nA doctor from China has sent to John's health track. The doctor noted John's BMI and medical history. He is currently at 70 years of age, at the age of 30.\n\nJohn's current weight is 30 pounds and his cholesterol is 114.\n\nAccording to your NICE classification of risk, he is considered to a high risk of CVD because he has a family history of either diabetes or high cholesterol. Therefore he is at increased risk for CVD.\n\nAt this stage, his doctor recommends an aspirin therapy based on the guidelines that WHO uses.\n\nHe recommends 200mg of aspirin a day for his high risk for CVD.\n\nFor the above calculation, John is considered to be at highest risk. In other words, he has a low health risk. At level two, the doctor can change that. At level three, he needs to make a referral to a cardiologist for further evaluation.\n\nFor those other cases including an early diagnosis of diabetes, John could be considered to have low or borderline cardio-metabolic risk, therefore would be on stage one of his disease. At that point, the doctor can recommend treatment to lower the risk of developing disease.\n\nLast edited by John's body weight is higher than 30kg.\n\n#### Related Questions\n\nBlog comments powered by Disqus\n\nSearch\nMembers\nMembers\n\nExpert-level health guidance\n\nMy family has a history of high cholesterol and high BP which made them feel unhealthy.

After an appointment with his primary care doctor, a 20 minute ultrasound showed that there is an increase in heart enlargement (atherosis). He had recently eaten a lot of fried food. His heart enlarged a little at first before he got worse. He does not have any type of cardiovascular disease or diabetes. He would be a candidate for a \"cardiovascular screening.\" I am wondering how to apply this information in the context of that individual situation. The health record card was signed by the doctor which is being used. He is an elderly man. In most cases who has a healthy weight when you have a BMI of 25-30, your heart size increases a lot as it gets bigger. This could be one component that makes my father a good candidate for an eh cardiographic assessment.\n\nWhen I was a child, my dad and some of the other seniors in my family were on a diet to lose weight. When I was a teenager or young adult my weight started to climb and I became a little overweight or obese. After about 15 years of eating healthy and exercising I have lost more than that. I'm pretty healthy and am enjoying life. I've tried losing weight and did nothing wrong and I would like to lose 100 pounds in about a year. I don't want to lose 150 pounds if that sounds too difficult. The best way would possibly be to have one of me do work which has to be done on a weekly basis over a 1 year period. That way I can gain some of my weight if I have the strength to do it. I did research on a friend who has been trying different things to lose weight. I'm not a nutritionist, dietetic or weight loss specialist. I look at what they've said about their weight and the number of calories they've eaten, how many of them have been inactive during my lifetime or are looking at the number of carbohydrates in the foods I eat. I know if I do 100 pounds that I can easily continue to gain about my previous 150.

The next step is to determine if a person has a genetic predisposition to heart disease. This disease is caused by abnormalities in the cardiovascular system, including arteries, nerves, and veins.\nThe most common form of heart disease, which can be hereditary, is coronary artery disease due to blood lack of certain substances, such as fibrin (blood clotting factor 1) and phospholipids and platelets in the blood. An individual with a family history of heart disease may also be more susceptible to high blood pressure, hypertension, and obesity.\nLifestyle and clinical risk factors\nAccording to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, there are several lifestyle factors that increase a person's risk of heart disease:\n- Smoking or chewing tobacco\n- Diet high in sodium (salt) and processed foods\n- Excessive physical activity or being overweight\n- Obesity (body mass index > 40 kg/m2)\nRisk factors caused by genetic factors\nThe family history of cardiovascular disease and the genetic factors that determine these risk factors are both important.\nAn individual might have high blood pressure, hypertension, and diabetes, with a family history of CVD.\nIt is important to know these risk factors and take appropriate measures to avoid them.\nThe NICE guidelines for cardiovascular risk management in older adults, based on the World Health Organization's (WHO) definition of CVD, include a diet high in sodium, processed foods, obesity/hypertension, and a sedentary lifestyle.\nThe guidelines, which were developed by the expert committee, state that following the National Cholesterol Education Programme (NCEP) standards in lifestyle modification should be an essential health decision.\nA person with a family history of disease must take all of it into account. A healthy diet is important for healthy blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and heart health.\nIt is not enough to simply focus on dietary changes. Physical activity is another requirement for healthy blood pressure, cholesterol and heart disease.\nLifestyle changes are considered the key, but these might need to be combined, rather than changing to a diet alone.\nAs you can see, it is important to understand how lifestyle factors can influence the risk of developing heart disease, and to take measures to reduce its risk if you are at high-risk.\nIt is also important to note that the risk of developing heart disease is not fixed in all cases, and different people may develop a condition in different circumstances that could not be addressed with lifestyle changes.\nIf you suffer from CVD, ask your physician for advice on modifying your lifestyle and discuss it with your physician.\nYou may also like:", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?\nNICE Guidelines for CVD Risk Management.

A higher proportion of patients with CVD is seen in younger age groups (for example, 6.76 percent are expected in 15 yrs). Patients with CVD or no CVD are the majority at high risk, and the proportion of people with a first degree relative who have CVD increases with age.\nThe NICE guidelines for CVD risk management require further studies on the exact nature of CVD risk factors and a standardised methodology to diagnose CVD.\nHowever, in order to assess cardiovascular risk the NICE guidelines do not include any methods of risk stratification or the use of biomarkers and CVD risk factors. However, they include a new technique for monitoring the prevalence and incidence of CVD in a population using existing data from the UK Biobank. Since CVD is a common risk factor for all diseases and CVDs are also the leading causes of death in our adult population, the analysis is expected to be robust.\nCVD risk is also complicated by inter-individual variation. This might be explained as a high frequency of high-risk groups (or high/low CVD risk groups) that is largely caused by multiple preventable factors. This is likely to lead to a greater potential for selection bias. Nevertheless, some key modifiable risk factors are well represented in the NHS risk and outcomes database, which may include patients (for example, those with an underlying heart disease) or other patients and may be able to be screened for and removed from analyses.\nThe first objective of the NICE guidelines, as set out in the Nutrition section, is to reduce the likelihood of CVD on-going. For instance, some research suggests that people might want to increase the amount of saturated fat (and/or cholesterol and/or added sugar) in their diet to reduce the overall CVD risk. To this end, people who lack cardiovascular disease risk factors should limit the amount of saturated fat on their diet to below 30 g/day. Similarly, they should limit to about 30 g", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?\nRecommendation 2: No cardiovascular risk factor should be the primary factor for CVD when making health decisions. Instead, consider these risk factors: blood pressure \u2265130/85 mmHg and total cholesterol \u22657 mmol/L, and LDL <125 mg/dL.\nNICE recommend that people aged 40 years and over who do not intend to stop, to quit smoking, should have one year of counseling or referral to an independent clinician.\nCurrent smokers who are \u226540 days after quitting should be advised to take 30 min of self-help training every day to decrease the amount of nicotine they are smoking. There are few evidence-based risk reduction information for the management of tobacco use. In summary, there is little evidence to recommend that new smokers who already used tobacco prior to quitting should still receive self-help guidance or counseling for preventing smoking, to stop smoking, and if need to quit by other means. Also, people should consider asking their doctor to recommend counseling for tobacco-related health problems they may have, based on their smoking history and any other personal or family history of CVD.\nOther risk factor management advice is based on a risk score of 0 or higher, as well as other risk factors that may be related to the cause of CVD, such as diabetes, history of heart failure, high triglycerides, lipid-lowering medications, hyperprolactinemia, and smoking history.\nFor those aged 40+ years and above, a risk score of 0 or less is indicated if there is significant cardiovascular risk or a low 1-HMO risk score in 7 to 10 SD increments. For those with a family history of CVD, a higher value or a low 1-HMO score indicates a higher risk of having CVD. The 1-HMO risk score is based on a model developed by NICE in collaboration with the University of Toronto. If the family history of CVD is present and a model based on 1-HMO risk scores were used to generate the 1-HMO score, the 1-HMO risk score would be 11 (a 10% probability of having CVD). For those aged 40 years or older, a risk score of 0 to less than 1.5 is indicated if the family history of CVD is present. For those aged 40 years and above a higher value has been suggested in NICE as a measure of CVD risk.\nThe 2-HMO risk score is a 2.5 SD (approximately 23%) from the 1-HMO risk score. For a person who is not smoking but has been active in a 2.5 and 7935 7-year trend and has a 0-HMO risk score of >1.5, the 1-HMO risk score has been proposed based on age-adjusted risk ratios (ARRs) calculated from data from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SINY) and the Canadian Heart Network based on the highest 1-HMO and lowest 2-HMO risk scores. For those who have a risk score of \u22652.5 and a 4548 1-HMO risk score, the 1-HMO risk score has been suggested based on historical 1-HMO risk scores.\nThese risks can be combined to obtain a more accurate risk score for the individual to be more precise in terms of risk reduction and the timing and effectiveness of interventions. Patients with high 1-HMO risk scores should talk to their doctors to obtain a more appropriate risk score, based on the individual patient needs and risk profiles, to evaluate their CVD risk.\nNICE is also recommending that people aged 40 years and above who do not intend to stop consider using personal and family history recommendations prior to considering self-help guidance.\nWhen considering lifestyle interventions, advice should be provided based on:\n- history of smoking\n- history of high triglycerides\n- history of elevated HDL cholesterol\n- history of diabetes\n- history of hyperprolactinemia and history of hypermenorrhea.\nThere is a large body of evidence for how diet and lifestyle modifyers work to reduce CVD morbidity, mortality and their effects on CVD morbidity and mortality, including their modulatory and protective effects for those with and without cardiovascular disease.\nThe Mediterranean diet is the predominant diet in Mediterranean countries.

These categories are calculated as follows:\n- When the average number of years a person is young when a CVD event takes place was used, the relative risk was zero. This means that the risk group of a person at any point in their lifetime was the same.\n- If the amount of each risk factor increased significantly over time, the relative risk was increased as well.\n- The person's gender-specific risk factor percentage was used: for women, this was the proportion of a person's lifetime risk of a cardiac event that the woman was at a high risk of having: this would be the mean risk factor percentage of males. For both men and women, the percentage of a person's lifetime risk of a cardiovascular event was measured in terms of women's or men's relative risk percentage.\n- The number of events as a result of the risk factors above was used as a means of calculating the relative hazard proportion of the person at any point in their lifetime, that is, the proportion of a person's lifetime risk of a cardiac event as a result of the risk factors above\nThe NICE guidelines for CVD risk management are as follows:\n- For the overall risk group (heart disease), any increase in all but the strongest risk factors (that were measured in Q-Model age- and gender-specific ways) was considered a significant increase in the total risk of a cardiac event (that is, a major factor in the woman's relative risk).\n- For the person in high risk or poor risk (that were measured in multiple other risk factors, at least two were measured with Q models of higher reliability) or the person in the lower risk, it was considered a significant increase in the total risk of a cardiac event (that at any point in her lifetime was due to the risk factors above).\nPlease note that these guidelines are not specific to CVD. They are based on an extremely strict, and therefore, highly complex, algorithm that was developed to show the effects of many different risk factor combinations and levels of risk. These individual, risk factor, factors are generally based on one or more evidence lists and recommendations from the American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC). This algorithm may, for example, use information based on the risk factors listed under the individual risk factor, the age and sex category of the person in the first category, and the age and sex category of that one at the time.\nYou are free to download and copy the PDF above in the right-hand sidebar.

How can this be reconciled with a 3-tier prevention approach?\nAs far as the risk factors are concerned, our health professional recommendation is to see you every three months for a comprehensive clinical review. The findings from this review should show both the level of cardiovascular risk and the degree of the degree of cardiovascular risk. The level of CVD risk is set through two points: the current annual heart rate that is above 115 beats per min.; and the risk of stroke. With the previous point, it has been established that people with a moderate level of risk should be screened more often. In order to avoid adverse effects, the level of cardiovascular risk is set in the framework established by the NICE in its guidance on screening patients in a timely manner (NICE Guidance 2012). However, since this guidance only applies to individuals with a current assessment, those patients who do not have a disease or condition should be treated for cardiovascular risk. Therefore, we recommend that the following prevention strategies should be considered first:\nFirst, individuals should be screened for early CVD risk in all patients with an annual high risk score (Q1, Q3, Q4), who demonstrate a CVD risk factor above 3 or a family history of CVD. Second, these patients should be screened for CVD risk factors that have been identified. Third, patients with moderate or low cardiovascular risk should be screened for CVD risk factors that are not identified by screening and should be enrolled according to the relevant patient profile. For those patients with a low risk score, screening should be avoided first because people with low cardiac risk are at an increased risk of dying from a cardiac event such as heart attack. For these patients, screening is a good strategy. Finally, patients with moderate or high cardiovascular risk should not be treated. Patients with high cardiovascular risk can have a good long-term prognosis.\nThe 4-tier prevention approach will be in accordance with an overall goal of lowering the number of adverse cardiometabolic conditions in addition to the number of adverse outcomes, such as coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, cancer, obesity, and pre-existing heart disease, and will be considered among the first-line preventive strategies for CVD.\nWe have not specified that patients with a current assessment or a family history of CVD but require a screening for cardiovascular risk, should be screened for cardiovascular risk in patients with a current assessment, or in patients who already have a recent presentation of CVD, and should be treated with appropriate cardiovascular risk factors as defined in NICE guidance? How can the screening process be arranged more easily and cost-effectively?\nIn principle, each patient should be screened for cardiovascular risk from time to time. If the annual annual risk exceeds 115 beats per min or there is a family history of CVD within a patient's family, an assessment should be immediately done, such as an electrocardiogram, cardiac stress test, C-reactive protein, and C-reactive protein markers. If the risk is greater than the average, such as in the setting of a 200-year-old smoker, a chest X-ray, EKG, and blood test, then a risk assessment with an ECG is conducted. However, unless the patient is experiencing symptoms such as dyspnoea, pain, or cough, and if the C-reactive protein level is above 20 nanograms/mL, a high risk assessment is recommended. Even if no symptoms are present, it is very important to have the risk assessed. Therefore, the relevant risk assessment procedure is to be done within 29 days from the first presentation or when any symptoms such as dyspnoea and pain become evident.\nWe suggest that the first approach to cardiac risk management is to establish a \"health educator\" who can carry out cardiac risk assessments for patients every 3 months. By doing so, the patient can be encouraged to learn the key signs and symptoms of poor health and to take action if they are concerned (Box 2). The following action steps should be taken if the patient appears to be at risk of cardiovascular disease.\n- Have regular and comprehensive family history and management of symptoms, including physical, dietary, and environmental risk factors. In addition, patients with a family history of coronary disease or other risks should be screened.\n- Perform a detailed annual cardiac risk assessment. In addition, a risk assessment in each individual should be conducted.\n- Provide education and awareness through communication campaigns to promote lifestyle and lifestyle changes that can reduce the risk of developing vascular disease and cardiovascular disease.\n- The healthcare professional should consult every patient who develops symptoms such as chest pain", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?\nWhat are the results from the 2015 ERS research and what do they suggest in terms of lifestyle advice?\nThe data were from a randomised controlled trial carried out by the ERS in Glasgow. All patients in the 1st stage were given a dose of statins, which the clinicians advise on every second day after a meal. That means this is why the levels of cholesterol dropped by 18% in the day after giving the statins (there is a range of 5% to 10-percentage point down from the standard dose). The proportion of patients who still have high levels of cholesterol was about 12%, even after the statin was introduced. It's like a drop from 18%. The percentage of patients in the 1st stage who still have high cholesterol is almost 30%, which is a huge level of success. In the 2nd stage the patient who still have high cholesterol was around 2%, and those were also going off the control.\nThe ERS study found that 37% of the patients in the 1st stage had been told by their physicians that they had had at least one major heart attack, of which only 3% had not done anything with the statins or no treatment at all. After a year following the ERS study these were about 10% of them smoking, as an analysis using their 2005 data showed they were about 10% more likely to have a new heart attack. What do you think could have been done differently to the previous 7 years?\nWe know that 3/4 of the patients in the previous study were not taking care of their cholesterol. The other four patients had a history of heart attacks. And that's a very large group - we don't have many more patients like that. So the ERS study showed really shockingly that we didn't be able to detect a difference between group A (those with one or more major heart attacks) and group B (those with a history of heart attacks). We don't think we got there with 1/4 of patients.\nWhat's the difference in results between heart attack patients and patients over a long period?\nFirst two years are a hard time for some patients. Some of them lose weight very quickly, some of them have other health issues, but most of them had an underlying problem. But as time goes on - so as heart attack treatments are becoming more and more available that actually work - heart attack symptoms disappear, so they have a better chance of recovery. We know that some of the patients we look at have been in an acute coronary event for a long time, but our average age is about 87, and we're about 48 in the year 2020. And even if patients had a history of heart attack a year ago they'd survive 10 years. The long-term studies show that those who have had such a event before and those who have suffered an episode with it are doing better than most (except one patient from last year). There is an underlying problem here - the problem is not only the individual but the whole population - there has to be a whole system for it. Once the 30 patients in the 2nd study get to see their GP, they have a list of the warning signs of heart attack. So even if they don't have a heart attack there is something they can do about it - that is the problem with cholesterol management.\nWhat can you teach people that they can do now?\nI want to tell them that heart attack is very unusual. It's one thing to get it and then not getting it. If it's more or less a minor heart attack, if it's not really serious it's very unlikely you will die from it. And to know this, is that part of the process and that is, of course, what the evidence shows. If you stop taking your statins, they stop working - the drug doesn't work. So, then what we're saying is that you want to lose weight if you have a heart attack, and this has more impact on weight loss than just stopping taking statins. I want to say that you actually can't do it without going to the hospital at the first sign of a heart attack. If you already have a heart attack you need to stay there at the hospital, because they prescribe medicines in an attempt to reduce the amount of cholesterol in the system, which means you're going to get angina, which is very painful \u2013 you stop taking statins,", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?\n\nYour NHS guidelines recommend total cholesterol to be as low as possible, for most men and women, with a few exceptions. The most appropriate targets are:\n\n1. Age 70s, or any non-metabolic risk factor in a person aged 70 years. (the 0-70-year range provides a baseline for this dose of risk reduction.)\n2. Hypertension: blood pressure <=120/85 mmHg; hyperlipidaemia. Hypoproteinaemia, or at risk for having hyperlipidaemia, is defined by the Framingham scale as having a combined 10% or greater reduction below 130 mg/dL in triglycerides.\n\nWe have another example above with a male with a blood pressure that is normal on a family history and high cholesterol and he has high blood pressure (this could be a result of eating too much salt and saturated fat). He should be given both LDL and HDL (good cholesterol). In addition, as a group's health insurance usually is more expensive and therefore cheaper options for him are available than the others. The best example for how they can look at both LDL and HDL is to see what's in our blood on a scale and then determine if they need to stop sugar.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nPeople with a sedentary lifestyle, or those who are overweight or obese, have a poor chance of reducing their risk of developing CVD and are advised to exercise more. If we do increase our activity we are also advised to reduce our smoking.\n\n#### Summary\n\nThis week I would like to go over five questions regarding risk reduction. If you are not sure what they are all about it will help me get more involved in the discussion.\n\n### What's the next step?\n\nOne of the key parts of the NICE guidelines is to look at one dose of risk reduction and what that means, what is the best dose, and how the different doses affect the risk each and every day. It also considers the risk if one dose is given more often, the other has less risk than the other.\n\nA big question to be asked is, is increasing exercise to 100%. There is a lot of research on this; most people have heard about studies with exercise and risk; and studies with exercise, and the results so far have been similar and in the end they are just a bunch of different studies. The difference is that some studies have concluded that as exercise stops or if it is over 2.5 hr more often you're not likely to have an increased risk compared to other studies.\n\nThere are also studies that suggest 100% exercise is not recommended.\n\nAnd other studies that suggest 70% exercise decreases cardiovascular disease, but it just isn't consistent.\n\nSo at this point in time, this is our next step in reducing CVD risk.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThis is the most complicated part about this question. Many different studies have been done about the best way to reduce CVD risk. It is not the same as the one we are discussing as a group, or with that person. It is what we do for our age in terms of healthy weight, but for other reasons. It could be taking a few minutes more often to exercise than when we were younger or having even healthier food choices. We need that question and the next step. It is an ongoing process. As time goes by it is a more accurate, more accurate model and we have to adjust to be less accurate than the past. But that does add up.\n\n### Thank You\n\nAs always, I appreciate your time.", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?\n1. \"No lifestyle alteration, no other action\". As a dietitian, I have read that the BMI and systolic and diastolic blood pressure and cholesterol levels are a more useful way of understanding CVD risk because they show both the magnitude of the risk and the extent to which the person's risk could be reduced by changing those habits.\n2. \"Cigarette smoking is the single biggest cause of premature deaths around the world\". The other factors that I would add are diet, physical activity, body mass index, diabetes type and blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar, weight, diet and alcohol, family history, family history of CVD, stress, diabetes and hypertension, and smoking. I am not sure of which of these points is considered most important, because it depends on individual circumstances. I would recommend starting an NICE trial at least every 5 years if you're at high risk.\n3. \"I am 70 years old, high HbA1c\" Because of my body type and family history of CVD, if I have HbA1c levels in the range of 39 - 46mmol/L, I think I was 60 years old if I have higher glucose levels in the range of 77 - 89mmol/L, I would check my glucose 13 times a previous year on fasting (or at least 6 hours after the last food consumed) and calculate hemoglobin A1c. If the result was 5-8%, I said, well I have low glucose and need to be 5 years younger. I need to be younger than 65 years old, I am 70 years old, can I still do that? Why?\n4. \"I am diabetic and high HbA1c\". If I had to choose a 5 year age range, I should not follow by 1 year, because a glucose level of 100g or more before 1 year of age is considered high, but 200g-300g after 1 year, which also means that I have high glucose. I do not know what age I belong to. Do you think I was too old to follow that recommendation?\n5. \"I am obese and have my LDL cholesterol below 6.5\" How can the results on the Hb1c in this case be interpreted? I would like to know whether my blood pressure measurement was lower. My blood pressure has been measured twice, a week earlier, and I know exactly which 20 mmHg has a greater effect on my diastolic blood pressure. I cannot think of any explanation for this. Do I just need to worry about my blood pressure and heart, or do I need more precise information like this?\n6. \"I am overweight and have high blood glucose\". I can't understand what this has to do with the hemoglobin A1c level and how it differs between people of similar weight. The numbers are clearly not significant in this regard. I would like to know if there are any differences between groups of overweight people of low and high BMI, and the effect on their blood glucose levels. In fact, I have been under medical surveillance on blood glucose control for about two years, and in one year I became very ill and, thus, was under medical surveillance.\n7. \"I want to follow my 12 months plan\". Because of my current weight and diabetes type, I cannot easily follow that plan of the NICE guideline. Is that really the case and if so, how can I modify your plan? My goal at the age I was 12 was to get 12 months of normal glucose levels. If that was not possible before 12 months, how would you proceed?\n8. \"I am 70 years old, high LDL\". \"I am an older man who has a history of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.\" In that case, how do you think this is affecting my LDL levels, since LDL cholesterol is a type of fat and that is how it is deposited in our blood vessels? I can't find anything, I cannot explain my own situation, in that case.\n9. \"I am young and overweight\". Would you know it when you see it, if I was 20 years of age when this was your blood glucose level? I am 30?\n10. \"I am 60 years old and 40% have type 2 Diabetes. I have been diagnosed as a diabetic. How should I take my blood glucose level in this case? What results do you", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?

You can eat less and exercise more, and choose an appropriate diet.\nIf you have type 2 diabetes or chronic kidney disease, you can make adjustments in insulin, diet, medicines, and lifestyle.\nSome people are able to go without medication if they live independently. They can do work or other activities to keep their quality of life up if they can do something healthy. You\u2019ll need to talk to your health care team about this when you\u2019re thinking about starting a medication with them.\nQ: If you have low blood sugar, can NICE guidelines help?\nQ: How much is too much?\nNICE guidelines recommend using the lowest dose for long-term control of your blood sugar. This includes a low dose that has not been shown in clinical trials to be effective at achieving a blood sugar level below 5.2 mmol/L\nIn the general population, we know that these doses of insulin are safe if used in combination with a low glycemic index diet and exercise.\nQ: How is an NICE guideline different from a WHO Guideline?\nNICE guidelines are independent; they're only used by organisations that need them. WHO have guidelines and the World Health Organisation have the WHO reference case studies for diabetes and heart disease.\nQ: Do we follow the World Health Organisation recommendation?\nIf you follow the WHO guideline, you can get more than one guideline if you follow a similar course.\nQ: What other people think?\nQ: What do you think is the most important advice for people with diabetes?\nQ: Which guidelines are the most important for people with heart and kidney disease?\n- Q: What advice would you like your doctor to give you for heart disease?\nQ: What are the more important guidelines for a young patient?\nQ: Is it true that the guidelines aren't all the same?\nQ: How can a person become a champion for their heart or kidney disease?\nQ: What are some of the most important steps people with diabetes should take?\nFor all of the important steps for people with diabetes and its complications, you see a specialist or a registered nurse doing it at least once a month.\nQ: For healthy people, can I use guidelines to make decisions about what can and cannot be done?\nQ: My BMI is very high. What can I do to lose my extra pounds while still keeping my weight up?\nMost people with diabetes can manage their weight with diet and physical activity, but you\u2019ll need to talk to your health care team if you're taking medicine or are planning a surgery. Your health care team can provide the best options.\n- Diabetes.
