At the end of the day, I did not get help on this because I wanted to be sure that I was making some good decisions. And all that I do is to save a client by using that information and letting it be used for further help without telling what it can do, or why it can do it. If you feel it's better to see a physical doctor, call NICE and ask for their referral for the most recent guidelines. If it's not your area, go find it through the websites and make a note in there the date that it was published. Once you get this information out there, you're helping people. So now my question is: when in Rome... what do these guidelines say? For example, does a person with low HDL cholesterol have to have a 4 year wait to have their level checked if this diagnosis is in the early \"Early Heart Failure\" model? If that is the case, the guidelines are all wrong. It says that the patient must have their health history checked before deciding that they need to treat them, and that is never the case. If I was to have my reading tested I will want to see the first year and make sure that it has a date of a 4-year waiting period. But how long that is, has been a debate for me for such a long time. Also, I'm not really sure what information the guidelines are about here and I do not understand how these specific guidelines can actually impact my patient. For example, if I'm in the early 90's and my doctor says that smoking stopped, I'm probably still left with a 0% risk of getting the disease. Then, they say that smoking 50 cigarettes a day can save me from 72% of my risk of dying. How do they make an idea like that? This is not the same way that I am supposed to treat a cardiologist, or any other doctor. This is the time I am able to give the patient something if they are going through something they can save. If I did, could someone help me see if the guidelines have an accuracy score that puts all doctors in terms of their accuracy? I cannot be too hard with myself. I have to do this now, let the doctor do the research for me, and the NICE guide makes no recommendations. I know the guidelines are based on some of the same criteria for medical doctors, so when my patient comes for a check-up, I will use the guidelines to guide my care.\n\nI have this advice:\n\nFirst, never trust information from the news or the press. Look it up.\n\nSecond, always have your reading checked before you get to your next appointment.\n\nThird, if you have any questions, I can just point to the guidelines at medical websites.\n\nLast resort:\n\nFor those wondering, I have tried reading the NICE guide, or checking it out online.\n\nYou could go for that one, but if I ever need that information, I'll want to make it available without trying your best to get it into the standard medical journal like the British Medical Journal. This is the only one I think of. And if I actually need it, I would probably go to this medical website.\n\nAnd if you have any questions, ask me!

It is a muscle with an extended diameter. A muscle has a different diameter than the heart. Therefore, we can define one as a muscle with an extended diameter, whereas the other is a muscle with a different diameter, which is as follows:\n\n* A normal-sized heart with an extended diameter measures 3 feet in length.\n* A normal heart with a shortened diameter, namely, measures 2 inches, is as follows:\n\n* A normal heart with a shortened diameter, namely, measures 3 feet 1 inch, is as follows\n* A normal heart with an extended diameter measures 3 feet, 1 inch, is as follows\n\nThus, all four persons will need a heart that exceeds or is less than the dimensions of their respective hearts. Since it is not sufficient to consider an individual's size as well as his/her shape, one must also take into account that their age, ethnicity and family history of CVD are all taken into consideration.\n\nIn such a case, a person has a relative risk of 27%, is a high-risk individual (higher than the 20%-of-risk level), or a low-risk individual (less than the 10%-of-risk level).\n\n#### A**\n\nSo the heart is a muscle, and its dimensions have a relation to the dimensions of the heart. Therefore, it is not a healthy area for the heart to be. Therefore, it must be evaluated as a risk factor and must be taken into consideration. In this case, a heart size of 3 feet (or at most 2 inches) and a lower-than-that-norm for a normal-sized heart would indicate that the individual is in an elevated or risk category. However, if a 3-foot-3-inch heart could be found in an adult normal-sized heart, it would have the property of having a higher-than-that-norm risk.\n\nFor this person, his/her adult heart was 13 inches in length and 7 inches in breadth. Therefore, his/her adult heart is a bigger heart. Thus, his/her adult potential cardiac risk is calculated by using 8 and 2^2-11, which are: 800 = 50, 2^2-11, 50.71, 11.85 etc., that is:\n\n$$13 \\overline { 2^2 - 11 * 50.71 } = 1160.075101$$\n\n### D**\n\nAs the individual is of a Caucasian, European, low-risk status, it must be taken into consideration that the standard for an adult American heart is 26.2inches. Therefore, the heart measurements for this person might be 26.2 inches long (and breadth) in the average chest size for a typical American heart (112.3 inches).\n\nTherefore:\n\n$$13 \\overline { \\pi{ ^2} - 11 * 50.71^{2} } = \\frac{1308.19}{1160.075101} \\approx 0.078970535$$\n\n### E**\n\nThis person would have a higher-than-that-norm risk category if he/she had a 3 foot-3 inch heart. Therefore, his/her adult heart was 5 feet 6 inches long (or at most 3 feet 1 inch) in length. Therefore, his/her adult heart is a bigger heart.\n\nIt is important to note that the above calculations only apply at 65% of the total number of people with a normal-sized heart (that is, 20%-of-a-normal-sized). Therefore, 41.0% of all people with a normal-sized heart will have a 3 foot-3 inch heart if they have a 3 foot 3 inch heart, as this assumes 65% of people have this size.\n\nTherefore:\n\n$$13 \\overrule { \\pi{ ^2} - 11 *", "John has these features: Age: 77, BMI: 28.5, Blood Pressure: 164/67 mmHg, \n    Total Cholesterol: 6.0 mmol/L, HDL Cholesterol: 1.0 mmol/L, \n    Smoking Status: ex-smoker, Diabetes: Type 2 diabetes, \n    Family History of CVD: no, Ethnicity: Black Caribbean.

As a researcher with expertise in epidemiology, I would need to ask more questions to understand why, for example, they are not already in the BMI range.

The services and services for people with heart disease or heart attacks are provided by NHS England NHS England services are based in the national hospitals for the treatment of heart disease.

This included a re-assessment of the care of people with complex medical needs who currently receive care at the most advanced level in hospital services. The aim of this reform was to improve patient outcomes, with the main objective of achieving a more high-quality care delivery system. NHS England provides \u00a32 billion in cost reduction funding to hospitals over the next three years to help hospitals increase rates of high-quality care.\n\nNHS England operates at 12 sites for out-of-hours treatment, and a network of specialist hospitals where treatment can be provided during the day and at night. NHS England also offers specialist services if required.\n\nTo read the original article click on the links below:\n\n## The NHS\n\nNHS England is the chief medical officer of the Department of Health. It is responsible for supporting public health in the UK and the rest of the world. NHS England\u2019s mission is: to deliver the Government's health services for all people in the UK\u2014for free. Its aim is to make hospitals and specialist services better for those without them. It is a public body.\n\n## The NHS\n\nThe Ministry of Health of the United Kingdom is where NHS England works and where NHS England makes decisions, all its life-saving medicines for people aged 65 or over. NHS England supplies the workforce and equipment needed to provide every service in the NHS.\n\nSince it was established in 1988, there are around 150 separate agencies and departments with duties across the NHS. It includes National Institute for Healthcare Research, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, the National Institute for Health Research, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, the National Institute for Quality Improvement of Outcomes Research, and the national funding agencies: NHS Foundation Trust, National Health Service Foundation Trust (FFT) and NHS Improvement, respectively.\n\nA central agency is the Chief Executive Office that acts as the national governing body for the whole of the NHS, it has over 400 personnel and carries out more than 56 million administrative activities every year.\n\n### The NHS\n\nThe NHS is not owned by the NHS General Council, and", "John has these features: Age: 77, BMI: 28.5, Blood Pressure: 164/67 mmHg, \n    Total Cholesterol: 6.0 mmol/L, HDL Cholesterol: 1.0 mmol/L, \n    Smoking Status: ex-smoker, Diabetes: Type 2 diabetes, \n    Family History of CVD: no, Ethnicity: Black Caribbean.

But at first I would not want to make a lot of research, and with the limitations of NICE, I would just find the recommendations and leave it to the experts themselves.\n\nI believe that people who follow advice from people who were not experts in cardiovascular medicine for years can better take a more positive outlook about life when they follow advice from people who are experts. In fact, the best thing that a person can do is to listen to the advice they get from experts, just like my friend had a great heart-valve surgeon, Dr. Dran.\n\nThe research I'm writing in this project is mostly based on my own personal observations, but it is based on NICE guidelines, which is an idea from the 1992 book \"The Patient\". A personal experience with the book helped me understand the reasons why people follow cardiology guidelines.\n\nHowever, I am aware that there are different views about heart failure and this is something I'm not aware of. For example, the advice I see is not always the same as that recommended by the NICE guideline.\n\nTo summarise: You shouldn't rely on advice from experts, but listen to your heart-valve surgeon if it seems too good to be true. Or you can listen to NICE guidelines, which I have included in an appendix on my previous homepage.\n\n### 34.

There have been studies, however, that have shown that the structure and composition of the blood's endothelium changes over time.\n\n###### Description\n\n\u2022 Endothelium is a membrane that lines the inner and outer lining of blood vessels, is normally smooth and domelike.\n\u2022 Endothelium is the most important organ because it controls blood flow, oxygenation and excretion of waste products.\n\nIn conclusion: The endothelium plays a key role in your overall, general heart health, and that of other organs and cells in the body.\n\nIf we make a simple assumption that blood flow can predict blood pressure (in other words, we can know if you are high on blood pressure or low on blood pressure, we can also do the same for your body's endothelium). Then, we find that heart rates increase with age (not only with the older age of people, but with age as well), and if you live long enough you are likely to see changes in your endothelium over time, which I will outline in this section.\n\nWith your average age of 35 (you were supposed to live around that age, but for one reason or another your heart stopped beating early and you fell ill), and for 1,000 years, your blood flow (with age) has increased, and this is not to be confused with changes in your endothelium, which does not appear at age 35.\n\nThis is a very oversimplification, though.\n\nIf your current blood pressure does not differ, either way it does not make a difference. However, over time your endothelium changes, so blood (and even nitric oxide) changes with age.\n\nThere have also been studies showing that high blood pressure (hypertension) and low blood pressure (hypotension) have different effects on the heart, but if each occurs at different times (say, every month or every week), the effect of each would be the same.\n\n###### Summary\n\nI'm pretty confident that our bodies do contain these different types of cells, and that this is completely normal. When we lose muscle mass due to injury, loss of bone mass, or aging, the body changes the kinds of cells it has in it, and therefore makes changes to the cells themselves.\n\nIf you're going to say that you can't keep on the road to aging, it is probably reasonable to say that there is a way to maintain good health. This is something that can be done.\n\nOne part that I find useful is that your body responds to stress differently from the rest of your body. You may feel like you are a little overweight or a little lazy, and", "John has these features: Age: 77, BMI: 28.5, Blood Pressure: 164/67 mmHg, \n    Total Cholesterol: 6.0 mmol/L, HDL Cholesterol: 1.0 mmol/L, \n    Smoking Status: ex-smoker, Diabetes: Type 2 diabetes, \n    Family History of CVD: no, Ethnicity: Black Caribbean. Based on these characteristics alone and ignoring everything else, such as the name, provide recommendations on CVD guidelines based on NICE for this person.\n\n    A brief summary of recommendations from NICE on how we should talk with our health care providers about a person as a CVD is: \n    * Use of a health coach to help you, or a doctor, or health care staff, to understand and manage your type 2 diabetes. Use a health coach to help you, or a doctor, or health care staff, to understand what your doctor has learned from having a care plan that describes you with a health coach as well as your health coach. If you are having problems with your care, consult your doctor or the health coach if you don't feel comfortable talking to your GP.\n\nYou should also remember that it is really a personal decision that what is best for you, not what is best for a coach. Your coach wants you to be healthy for your age and activity level, not for the coach.\n\nHope it helped!\n\nI've just been diagnosed as a diabetic just last night. I thought that I could get some diabetes guidelines from NICE and what else I should know to prevent and control my diabetes to a good degree. I just want to get rid of the stigma that diabetes is a disease that is very difficult to cure and that I must pay for a lifetime of drugs.\n\nI really appreciate any help on this!\n\nCheers.\n\nHope it helped!\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you are in a dilemma. My heart was broken when I received the diagnosis. The fact that I'm overweight and have type 2 diabetes is a wake-up call for me. But what I thought is a good thing is that I didn't have to stop working out and living a healthy lifestyle to help my condition better. When I began, I could count my calories and still manage to maintain an ideal weight. What is different now though? I'm so busy trying to get off of pills and work out and just focus on the diet I believe makes me healthier overall, not on the weight. I'm eating well anyway, and doing the best things I can to get my blood sugar under control for the rest of my life. Thank you for sending me good advice.\n\nI just need to know, what's my best way to handle myself if I feel bad without taking out the stigma of my diagnosis?\n\nCheers\n\nKelly\n\n#### gautam515854\n\nGood day!\n\nHi,\n\nIn general I've tried all the suggestions for what I should consider or to prepare a nutrition plan and I've felt some things that I am concerned about. For example if I can't eat enough bread, I am worried about how all the information on bread will cause problems with my life. This would make it difficult. I wonder if I need to change this as well and how much I have to put on the balance. I think that if the person doesn't know what's good for them, they will be left wondering why they have to make a choice so that is not what they want to change.\n\nI have started my food journal and now that I am starting I have to be very critical with my decision I take. As I read a lot, I was thinking more of what is good for me and what won't suit me so that I would decide what I want to buy and what I should be giving myself time to be grateful for by eating for a month. When I finally decided in which direction to grow my little garden on my kitchen table, I was so determined and so determined there really is nothing better than growing it and eating the product once the day is over.\n\nI have a food diary, so I can see how many meals I eat and the products I do eat and how I consume. This helps me with the balance I should think of with my body so that I do not feel bloated or full. I also have a food journal for the children. This takes it a bit harder because children like to get up and then eat. When the time arrives, I try to find a different snack that I will eat with my meals and will not be tempted. I can always stop the snack when I get home from school and eat it again before I go to bed too.\n\nThanks very much for any kind of help or advice if anyone will pass along.\n\nCheers\n\nKelly\n\n#### gautam515854\n\nAh, that's", "John has these features: Age: 77, BMI: 28.5, Blood Pressure: 164/67 mmHg, \n    Total Cholesterol: 6.0 mmol/L, HDL Cholesterol: 1.0 mmol/L, \n    Smoking Status: ex-smoker, Diabetes: Type 2 diabetes, \n    Family History of CVD: no, Ethnicity: Black Caribbean.

In addition, NICE will provide guidance for NHS clinicians on the analysis methodology.\nThe following is a shortened excerpt from their guidance:\n\nGiven our results and the fact that cardiovascular disease is a modifiable risk factor, the evidence supports the clinical importance of addressing smoking status as an important risk factor in the early detection of cardiovascular disease in otherwise normal and healthy adults.\n\nHowever, even those who are not smokers must be aware that some people who smoke do not necessarily have [1] the same [2,3,4] risk of cardiovascular disease.\nThe question and implications related to these two questions are discussed differently in this report.\n\nIn one study [5] assessing the modifiable risk factors [6], we found that approximately 3,500 participants were smokers, compared with a small (10%) of only 1,300 or 15%, while smoking was more common in the elderly [5].\n\nThis could explain why our findings indicate low or no prevalence of smoking among 12,534 patients (20%.), compared to the 13,023 who are not smokers (47.1%).\n1. What are the modifiable risk factors that increase the rate of cardiovascular disease?\n\nWe have only included adults of all ages (12 or older) who meet the specific criteria of hypertension (hypertension > 140 mmHg), dyslipidemia (hypertriglyceridemia < 200 mg/dL), diabetes (has type 2 diabetes or either [7] type 1 diabetes).\nFor details see NICE Guidance on the Monitoring of Cardiovascular Disease.\nhttps://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/n481\n\n### Answer 3\n\nNo, a single type of medication, such as smoking cessation medication could still be an important approach for people with diabetes to lower their risk factors for cardiovascular disease.\nIt has not been clear whether this is the best approach for all patients, unless both types of treatment are undertaken with differing benefits and risks.\n\nIn patients who are not smokers, the number of patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease may be reduced dramatically with smoking cessation and diet modification strategies used to lower blood pressure.\n\nThe risk of cardiovascular disease remains high in smokers even after accounting for smoking status and number of patients who meet the criteria for CVD.\nThe risk of CVD remains largely unchanged after smoking cessation and diet modification strategies are used.\n\n## 8 Comments\n\nHello I have the same question.

They may well also have similar levels of awareness of the risk factor, and would do well to note this when discussing their health care.\nI understand the data from NICE is a good start, however.

Do you think this is in your hands to control it? Perhaps, based on other people's experience?\n\nWhat are the risks for that person? Will it lead to the problems that I may have identified?\n\nIf it causes any of that, why is this a risk?\n\nIf it doesn't, then I'd be very interested to know in a scientific way what was done or not done to eliminate this risk.\n\nHope it helps, and again, if you have information to share I'd welcome it.\nUpvotes: 2 username_2: If it is a rare condition, there is perhaps much to be gained by discussing this. For example:\n\n```\n1. If you do not smoke, then you should not smoke.\nIf you don't exercise regularly, you will have to work harder.\nIf you have diabetes or hypertension, you will have to treat them more closely; or you will take several doses of medicine, with or without the help of your doctor.\n\nIf you have risk factors, then you should change them. If you don't have high blood pressure, or your risk is low, and you are taking regular exercise, you're more likely to have other risk factors, such as smoking.\n\nIf you go to the doctor, you will be able to decide what treatments you need. But if one of these things is done without being well informed, and you have never been well informed, then you should not be doing anything.\n\nIf there is something we can offer that can help you avoid problems, then by all means offer it. But if after some time it's not something you think of anyway, talk to your doctor about it and ask him to find the best course of treatment for you.\n\nAlso, don't forget that this doesn't necessarily mean that you can't have surgery, it simply means that other treatment options are less useful.\n\nIn addition, for any treatment to be best, it really doesn't matter whether or not it is in your interest to do it.\n\nFor example, if you decide that there is a benefit in using a drug or a surgery to have your blood pressure and glucose levels normalized, then you should keep trying it. In addition, if it is a non-serious medical condition, then you don't have to worry about it and do not do anything.\nUpvotes: 0 ", "John has these features: Age: 77, BMI: 28.5, Blood Pressure: 164/67 mmHg, \n    Total Cholesterol: 6.0 mmol/L, HDL Cholesterol: 1.0 mmol/L, \n    Smoking Status: ex-smoker, Diabetes: Type 2 diabetes, \n    Family History of CVD: no, Ethnicity: Black Caribbean.

Based on these characteristics alone and ignoring everything else, such as the name, provide recommendations on CVD guidelines based on NICE for this person, but such a recommendation is NOT supported by the guidelines and there is no evidence of their validity. It is only to make conclusions on CVD based on a person's specific profile that such recommendations should not be made when a person is treated by an independent health professional.\n\nWhat are the results of this analysis? Overall, this would suggest that 49.7% or around 53.0 kg/m2 would seem to be at 5% of the risk of developing CVD. Since 9.2% of men should aim to reach this 5% of their risk, a reduction in the range of about 20.0%, is given. What should we do? If you follow the guidelines the following recommendation needs to be made:\n\nTo help prevent CVD in this person, this person's diet and Lifestyle behaviour needs to be changed.\nIt is not surprising that the most effective dietary changes would be to eat an appropriate amount of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains (such as sweetpotatoes, carrots, peas, chickpeas, brown rice, beans, and quinoa - whole grains). One example of these are, whole-grain breads and cereals, brown rice and pasta, and whole-grain bread and breakfast cereal. Also, it is recommended to include a variety of vegetables and salads. However, more research is needed on the impact of these foods, especially if they are eaten as part of a balanced diet.\nIf you follow the guidelines for the person's diet, this person should ideally eat small portions daily, or only once each day or at least after lunch has been finished. If this person followed the recommendations, their diet in this case should be low in fat content, low in sodium and cholesterol content, with a minimum quantity of calories, depending on age, gender, and activity level. For example, for men the suggested limit in dairy would be 400g for women, based on a weight (BMI) of 40 kg.6 or above, depending on activity level of both partners, in order for both partners to meet their calcium requirements. This limits the intake of calcium, which is the main constituent of both bones and teeth and a vital part of the diet for both sexes, and also for bone health, and can be an important component of the diet for reducing fat levels in the body and thus reducing heart and blood vessel disease.\nHowever, this person needs to follow the advice for their weight at the meal plan to help them meet the recommended number of servings for a variety of vegetables, fresh fruit or green salad, legumes and beans (chock-a-block for beans!), and whole grain bread or cereals. The diet of your friend or relative would be the same.\nAlthough the recommendation for these foods is based on data from around the world, people's variations in diet are so great that this particular recommendation should be applied and adjusted to fit the individual.\n\nIt is also important that these people meet the recommendations that are found in the NICE guideline as part of an improved health profile of the person because they cannot provide advice to them about lifestyle activities, such as physical inactivity.\nThis recommendation would not be to make any dietary recommendations that are based off the eating habits of the population as a whole. The idea is to suggest what the person can accept and adjust to, because the individual lifestyle needs will be assessed using a range of factors that can vary from one person to another.\n\nIf the individual follows the recommendations for the diet, the next steps might be to refer the person to a healthcare professional for further assessment of their level of risk of CVD. The following evidence does not support the use of these recommendations for their individual health profile.\nPeople should be told to follow this person for an assessment of their level of risk of CVD and the person's lifestyle behaviour. Further evidence to support the individual recommendations will be recommended in the next months.\n\nThe evidence for the need of the individual lifestyle in heart patients is strong, which shows that lifestyle behaviours need to be encouraged, especially to be incorporated and made aware of regularly and with support by a qualified health professional.\nYou can find out more about supporting your clients with the advice of your professional for a detailed report on this topic.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe importance of the dietary advice for the persons involved in the patient-centred care of cardiovascular patients (with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease ) is now clearly illustrated, and support for the recommendation", "John has these features: Age: 77, BMI: 28.5, Blood Pressure: 164/67 mmHg, \n    Total Cholesterol: 6.0 mmol/L, HDL Cholesterol: 1.0 mmol/L, \n    Smoking Status: ex-smoker, Diabetes: Type 2 diabetes, \n    Family History of CVD: no, Ethnicity: Black Caribbean.

If these are the main predictors of CVD, what are the 4 main strategies for intervention that might be the most effective?\nB. 1) Quitting smoking.\nRationale: If smoking has a significant risk for CVD, quitting smoking will reduce the CVD risk.

What can 0.8% of people on no smoking, quit smoking as soon as possible, to have an 85% risk reduction?\nD1) 12.5-16.9 kg\nRationale: 12.5 kg of bodyweight is the weight range for premature adult and young adult women\nQ. I'm not a medical student or nurse, so what are the main approaches for managing cardiac illness and/or acute-onning? If your question is \"what procedures are available to help people with heart problems and acute illness? \"\nD2) If a patient with an arrhythmia (blocked ECG) isn't on drugs, \"doesn't have a device to help them?\n\nD1) How do you treat arrhythmia or arrhythmia-related symptoms such as dyspnea?\nQ. Which cardiac event has more mortality: a 50 year-old man with CAD or a 5-year-old US born child with CAD or stroke?\n?\nD2) Where in the heart's care, if there is any risk of arrhythmia, how does the care transition between younger and older age?\nRationale: If there has been an acute event in the heart such as a heart attack, or if an older age has been mentioned during a procedure, all those patients are at higher risk of arrhythmia. 1 year after the event is very high risk of developing a cardiac arrest (sudden death), and may be fatal.\nRationale: A 50 year-old man and his US born child may have cardiovascular or respiratory arrhythmia and be at increased risk for both.\n\nD2). What is the role of the surgeon in assessing the cardiac risk and the timing of intervention for the younger and older age groups?(based on the NICE 2015 guidelines on young person cardiac risk: what is the role of the surgeon?).\nQ. What would you like to hear about my patient and my family who has an existing medical condition which has been on medication for them previously? (based on the 2015 guidelines on medication management for medical conditions?)\n\nD2) Who should I see?\nQ. Where can I find out more information on cardiac disease and its management?\n3. How do you classify the risk for high-risk cardiovascular events given to the patient?\nL. Which specific clinical situation are you in, and why?\nQ. What are the main factors affecting one's outcome?\n\nD3)- What type of intervention is best to reduce cardiovascular incidents?\nRationale: When a patient is at low risk, non invasive intervention is the same as a low risk intervention. When there is high risk, a low risk intervention such as pharmacological therapy is the best option.\nWhat does a high risk intervention look like and how should this be managed?\nA1) If the patient's first choice is pharmacological therapy, if one is able now to control the underlying cause, consider non-pharmacologic measures, such as exercise, smoking cessation or decreased consumption of alcohol.\nB1) If there is no choice, if the patient is not smoking (which is extremely important) and if the patient does not have a significant medical condition (such as a heart attack, stroke or coronary artery disease), consider a medication-specific intervention.\nThe best way to treat one's cardiovascular risk when there is no indication, is to avoid risk factors (such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes", "John has these features: Age: 77, BMI: 28.5, Blood Pressure: 164/67 mmHg, \n    Total Cholesterol: 6.0 mmol/L, HDL Cholesterol: 1.0 mmol/L, \n    Smoking Status: ex-smoker, Diabetes: Type 2 diabetes, \n    Family History of CVD: no, Ethnicity: Black Caribbean.

She used a cardiovascular risk factor calculator to determine her blood pressure (BP) at the previous visit and her blood lipid profile were all normal. Before starting this study, Jayne had been doing well in her clinical care over the past year, so she should have been out of heart trouble.\nThe follow-up visit was two months after the previous visit and Jayne was also asked for her BP and blood lipids. During the follow-up visit, her BP was 90.7 mmHg with a total cholesterol of 9.1 mmol/L. She had never smoked and had regular doctor visits. She did not have diabetes, but her total cholesterol level was 6.6 mmol/L with an HDL level of 3.1 mmol/L. All her medications are listed on the medication form. She has a diet that is vegetarian and she does not eat red meat. She did not smoke and has not had her first heart attack.\nThe follow-up visit was 10 months and Jayne had a stroke when she was less than one year old, so she was 6 months older than she was at the time of her consultation date. She has no cardiovascular disease. She is not diagnosed with any other diseases.\nThe follow-up was made from the day prior to the first visit to the follow-up clinic visit, which she missed from the previous visit. She was referred to her practice for further follow-up on June 21, 2012.\nTo determine the overall incidence of heart disease and any risk factors were used:\n- Cardiovascular disease (CVD) includes heart attacks, sudden cardiac death, and deaths due to heart problems in general.\n- Triglyceride was categorized as normal, elevated, or high (defined as the total cholesterol level \u2265200 mg/dl or HDL <40 mg/dl or triglyceride level \u226517.5 mmol/dl).\n- Cardiovascular diseases included the types of atherosclerotic diseases to which John is a smoker.\n- Diabetes was classified according to the Canadian Diabetes Association 10 percent threshold.\n- Other risk factors included age, sex, race, and socioeconomic factors.\nJohn was diagnosed with heart disease after starting the following medications: hydrochlorothiazide IV (Metoclop) 10 mg IV, aspirin 258 mg IV, and calcium gluconate 250 mg IV.\nKristi had no cardiovascular disease in this year.\nKirsten\u2019s blood lipids and cholesterol levels are normal according to her BP test.

His blood pressure is 114/61 mmHg, and his total cholesterol is 6.7 mmol/L with an HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L. He is a current smoker, does not have diabetes, but has a family history of CVD.\nThe information is in the form of a flowchart. First, one should note that the person is healthy by the time she signs the form. Second, one should note that the person with cardiovascular disease had a BMI of 30 and his total cholesterol was 6.7 mmol/L.\nThird, one should note that John doesn\u2019t smoke and has no history of hypertension. Fourth, one must note that if his total cholesterol was 1.0 mmol/L and his HDL cholesterol was 6.7 mmol/L, then both of these readings need to be in the range of 6.0-10.0 mmol/L.\nAlso note that if the two readings for John were both greater than 110.9, then it does not mean that he is in cardiac disease. It only means that he is very likely to have high cholesterol.\nIf what John had been doing, that is, making healthy lifestyle changes, is not working, and he is very likely to have cardiac disease, NICE suggests that John has elevated blood cholesterol. This is part of a series of guidelines, or standards, from the US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the American College of Cardiology to evaluate how our hearts process and regulate the cholesterol circulating in our blood.\nNICE recommends that people with coronary artery disease have the following cholesterol goals:\n- Blood cholesterol levels below 100 mg/dl (1.0 mmol/L)\n- LDL cholesterol levels of 130 mg/dl/mmHg (less than 120 mg/dl)\n- total cholesterol levels of 50 mg/dl (less than 110 mg/dl)\n- HDL cholesterol levels of 40 mg/dl or higher\nThese goals are part of the new \u201cpre-hypertension\u201d guidelines released by NICE.\nAs I mentioned earlier, people with high cholesterol have been defined as having a major cardiovascular risk factor if they have a 15-year average blood cholesterol level of 200 milligrams/dl (mg/dl). A 200 mg/dl or higher level is considered high. Someone with a 180 mg/dl or higher level is considered high risk.\nBut, if you have a history of heart disease or stroke, then you have an elevated cardiovascular risk, as well. So, NICE recommends that heart disease and stroke rates rise from the 1980s (in the United States and UK) into the 2000s (in other parts of the world, as much as 20% of the population has a high cholesterol level, and it is a strong risk factor for the development of heart disease or stroke).\nThese two factors, first, increase the potential for cardiovascular diseases and heart attack, and second, improve the risks of developing CVD, stroke and heart failure, as well.\nThese are part of a series of guidelines from the NICE guidance note, \u201cThe development and monitoring of guidelines for public health,\u201d which NICE is developing into a report, \u201cCardiovascular disease.\u201d\nPart 1: Heart disease\nPart 2: Heart failure\nPart 3: Stroke\nPart 4: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other heart diseases", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30.

He is a current smoker, does not have diabetes, but has a family history of CVD.\nFor the study, 24 of the study population were randomly selected within a 6-week period in which they would self-report on their medical history and fitness (exercise and leisure-time physical activity) for the duration of three time points (for the next 10 days, for a 3- and 6-week evaluation) over a 2-month period. The research protocol was approved by the protocol review committee (NCC), ethics, and human ethics committees.\nThe 10-day follow-up was a 6-week period after the subjects were selected for enrollment in the study. To obtain an objective assessment of their fitness baseline, a 1-kilometre walk test was taken at baseline and 6-week follow-up.\nDuring the study period, the subjects were recruited through all community-based organizations, and individuals were referred or referred to the research center for the purposes of self-reported CVD risk assessment by attending their health clinics.\nDuring the first 6 weeks of the study, the study subjects were assessed in terms of their CVD risk. A 24-h free-time cardio run was then taken on two occasions, with the first day assessing their cardio-respiratory fitness as well as their physical activity level.\nAt 6-week follow-up, the subjects were again assessed by the same method. Each session, the participants completed questionnaires about their health behaviors, physical activity, and fall-related demographics (BMI, systolic blood pressure), and their fitness assessments (electronystagmography and electromyography, respectively). Data regarding each study participant were collected over two times.\nCompared with the lowest risk subjects at baseline, the highest risk subjects at 3-week follow-up were 37 percent lower but 100 percent taller, and 80 percent less fit (in muscle-based, aerobic exercise only, whereas in combination with other forms, the subjects had about twice their fitness after 6 weeks, but 1.5 times the weight reduction rate). They also had about 17 more episodes of back pain on consecutive days.\nDuring the study period, 72 percent of subjects (95 percent of the subjects 10-years younger) reported the highest average physical activity level, 19 percent reported the lowest, and 77 percent reported their least active, walking/running form with the least level of physical activity (1 or 2 times a week, preferably 3 or 4 times a week). A higher level of physical activity and a lower level of stress or depression had an effect on a longer life.\nThe authors concluded, \u201cThe importance of a daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity level is supported\u201d by their results. The study found that the higher a person\u2019s level of physical activity, the less likely he or she was to have more severe health conditions.\nThe authors concluded, \u201cThese results support the hypothesis that daily physical activity plays an important role in mitigating the negative effects of physical inactivity on health. The authors further concluded, \"Further study is recommended to assess the impact of weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on risk factors for cardiovascular disease, specifically, a decrease in the risk of CVD and mortality from cardiovascular disease, and a significant improvement in the quality of life of a subject, who is no longer obese and is of normal weight.\u201d\nThe study was conducted by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).\nThis study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, HKU Grant 42231121 and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University 2014-0537.\nThis study and the conclusions reached here should not constitute professional advice for specific patient problems.\nLinda Seng and Zi-Min Yu, (Journal of Nutrition, 2014; 144 (Supplemental Information): 77\u201382)", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30.

He is a current smoker, does not have diabetes, but has a family history of CVD.\nJohn reports that his physical examination, chest xrf (CT), and electrocardiogram (ECG) have normal values but a history of dyslipidemia and hypertension. With regular exercise, and with his diet high in red meat, John has an 8-hour, 3-hr pulse to get to his target heart rate range (the goal being 90-100% of his maximum heart rate, although this does not mean he will exercise at top level). There are no symptoms.\n\u201cI was a sports enthusiast for three years, but I missed a lot of it. I had to lose my favorite track record, running, which again made everything look a little bad at the time,\u201d John reports. \u201cI was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, so I went to a nutritionist. At first, she told me how to avoid sugar cravings, but I also went hiking every day with my son the day before (4 weeks later) and kept a food journal of what I like and dislikes; these data helped me find new foods.\u201d\nFor John, this meant avoiding sugar, which in itself was a struggle at the time, so he decided to do some extra liposuction and, later, to change up his diet. He\u2019s now a certified nutrition coach, and for this interview, I talked with his nutrition coach, who just so happens to be also the first to test us out of John.\nSaid the expert nutritionist: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a diet that is balanced and balanced. But I\u2019ve found a balanced diet that includes all the nutrients you need. There are times, however, that you don\u2019t get the nutrients your body needs. For example, a vegan diet is probably too protein-heavy, so it\u2019s also important to include good sources of protein, like beans, lentils, and nuts. It\u2019s also important to include a good source of calories, like milk and yogurt, which have many very important nutrients. And last, but not least, it\u2019s important to know that not everything you eat is the same, especially vitamins and minerals. The best way to increase your chances of health and good health is by choosing food groups that are balanced, and eating a variety of them. There are many different balanced diets, including the 24-com-pair concept, which includes a good mix of whole, plant-based food groups.\u201d\nWhen John decides to cut out sugary drinks and red meat, he feels a change in health and well-being. However, he also feels, as the NHS explains, that eating less saturated fat and cholesterol leads to heart attacks and strokes. \u201cBecause carbohydrates contain a lot of fat, and fats will remain in the blood for a very long time, they\u2019re very dangerous for the circulatory system,\u201d says John. \u201cA low-carb, high-fat diet without any other fats, which will be low in saturated fat and cholesterol, will be beneficial, especially for cardiac patients.\u201d\nAs the dietitian explains, the NHS states that, according to these guidelines, healthy people should have less than 10% of their total calorie intake from animal sources, such as meat, fish, poultry, and dairy. They also advise an average of 50g of fibre per day, 30 to 60g of fat, and 5g of protein per day. \u201cThe Mediterranean and paleo diet differ a lot in what they include, which is good. For the paleo, the ideal is 19.2g of protein per kilo of body weight, 15g of carbs per kilo and 3.2g of fat per kilo. For the Mediterranean, the ideal is 14g of protein per kilo, 11g of carbohydrates per kilo and 2.5g of fat per kilo. They do have differences, and this is worth noting. We know that there are nutrients in foods that don\u2019t change the way our bodies interact, but the best food you eat in comparison to your cholesterol and sodium is a variety of nuts and seeds, and the same is true for vegetables.\u201d\nJohn also tells me \u201cI like to include my favourite vegetables in the menu in an effort to keep a balance in my foods. I try to eat everything that contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids together, so the ratio tends to be 6:4 and this is what I\u2019ve found.\u201d\nI", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30.

The next step is imaging with chest-imaging technique:\n- Dilated or coronal chest angiography\n- CT coronary angiogram or cardiac catheterization may be needed, if the patient's EKG, echocardiography or CT angiogram is abnormal\nBased on these findings, it is deemed that John is a candidate for the DIVAR\u00ae Coronary Artery Disease Evaluation (CAAD), a study that takes the patient's blood sample and evaluates various factors such as:\n- Total cholesterol\n- High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)\n- Total cholesterol and HDL-C (excretory)\n- Triglyceride (lipid)\n- ApoE (hypertriglycerida), LDL-C, anti-HDL-C\n- Triglyceride level and HDL level (anti-HDL-C and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein)\n- Heart rate and heart rhythm (RTS).\nBased on these results, the team will conduct a physical exam and blood exams and give the patient appropriate information to educate them on how to take care of themselves in order to prevent CAD (cardiovascular disease for heart). Other screenings include:\n- Coronary cycle risk factors\nThe team will discuss lifestyle options with John, such as:\n- Weight loss\n- Physical activity\n- Eating a nutritious diet full of fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy, and maintaining a healthy body weight, cholesterol balance and blood pressure control (HDL-C)\n- Avoiding tobacco products\n- Don't drink alcohol, especially if you've been drinking for three or more months with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) past 0.08 (100 per cent safe).\nThe team will also help patients make healthy eating decisions and exercise guidelines. This includes how to eat and stop eating and the use of drugs that can help control hypertension.\nIf you are 65 or older, it is considered high risk and there are no age limits for your participation in CAAD. The Catheter-related Atherosclerotic Disease Prevention Trial (CRAND) study is a randomized controlled trial aimed at providing the best overall cardiovascular benefit to date. This trial will consist of 63,658 patients, and provides information on the benefits.\nPatients should be randomly enrolled into a 90-day study period to begin treatment with the study medication or investigational agents at the start of the trial. The trial drug or investigational agent is prescribed daily for 90 days through a period of 12 weeks. To participate, patients must satisfy the following criteria:\n- 12 years or older\n- Diagnosed or suspected coronary artery disease and/or heart failure\n- Have at least one risk factor for CAD (high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking)\n- Have already entered a maintenance heart failure protocol that includes 30 days of continuous aspirin therapy, which include aspirin 3,480 mg or higher daily\n- Maintain a normal weight\n- Take statins within 21 days of starting the trial\n- Stop smoking within the 5 days after the start of the trial\n- Not otherwise experiencing a history of aspirin therapy or anti-hypertensive therapy.\nAfter stopping the trial, the patient and their family members will receive financial help and will be asked to maintain a reasonable lifestyle throughout the patient's stay in the study.\nThe CRAND trial has shown", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30. His blood pressure is 114/61 mmHg, and his total cholesterol is 6.7 mmol/L with an HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L. He is a current smoker, does not have diabetes, but has a family history of CVD. He has been reported by friends when he is at home drinking alcohol (which can be as high as 7:2 as recommended by NICE), usually in the evening but may be at work. He is also given a very high risk of coronary heart disease. His history was assessed using the Edinburgh Cardiac Risk Assessment Tool (EcoRATE). The ECORATE consists of 100 items to determine a person\u2019s risk of cardiovascular disease and is not designed to diagnose or prescribe preventive strategies or a blood pressure lowering scheme. The study uses this tool for the assessment of coronary heart disease in John.\nThis is the second study performed by NICE in this field, which used this tool to assess coronary heart disease. The ECORATE has been revised in September 2015: coronary heart disease risk is now assessed for each person separately by using the ECORATE. In the first analysis of the ECORATE, the risk was not decreased, even though John already had a reduced heart rate of 78 beats per minute due to age-related increase in heart rate variability and the reduction in coronary blood vessel pressure in response to alcohol. Although this was found to be clinically relevant, the reduction in heart rate variability did not necessarily translate to a reduction in blood pressure despite the use of a blood pressure cuff. In this analysis, the reductions in blood pressure due to reduction in heart rate were found to be statistically significant. These results suggest that the ECORATE, which was previously introduced to the ECCT, could have a large negative effect in the reduction in blood pressure in John.\nThe third study performed by NICE is a follow-up study of John, who is older than 65 and has no history of diabetes or coronary heart disease. NICE is planning a long-term followup of John over five years in order to understand whether he remains unaffected. NICE is also considering whether John should receive ACEi or PCSK9 inhibitors for treatment of coronary heart disease, after 3-years. Because John already has a healthy lifestyle, this could potentially help identify individuals with a high risk of CHD.\nThe fourth study performed by NICE and the Scottish Heart Fund is an effort to measure the impact of a BP control intervention in a large population cohort. The aim of this study is to provide evidence into the effects of an educational intervention to help people control their blood pressure within healthy range.\nThe Scottish Heart Fund is interested in the results of all of these studies and the extent of success in the community. The Scottish Heart Fund is seeking applications for funding to conduct the clinical trials of their project, but they were limited to 400 patients.\nScottish Heart Fund Clinical Trials\nThe Scottish Heart Fund has the highest number of patients waiting for a cardiac specialist, so funding to conduct this type of research is limited. However, this fund has funding for ongoing research, which in turn, provides more evidence on the efficacy of the intervention.\nThe Scottish Heart Fund has several clinical trials under way. The Scottish Heart Fund is conducting a new drug trial in children to investigate whether PCSK9 inhibitors improve systolic blood pressure, but no trials have been conducted yet on the efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors against CHD. This trial is being funded by Dr. Chris Evans, a professor in the Scottish Heart Fund\u2019s Heart Research Group.\nWhile there is a current limitation in the results of this clinical trial compared to other trials, Dr. Evans and others have been involved in an important trial in children, called CHW Trial. This study used an intensive blood pressure management regimen. Researchers believe that the trial will provide evidence in order to see if it produces a significant improvement in the lower blood pressure in the child after 3 visits.\nOther trials are under way in Scotland, with funding from the Scottish Heart Fund and the Scottish Executive Fund.\nThe Scottish Heart Fund is currently researching the treatment of high blood pressure in children. The aim of the study is to develop an agent to prevent high blood pressure in children. The research team is seeking funding for 16 studies in children. The aim of these studies is to see whether this agent helps control high blood pressure.\nA trial is currently underway in Scotland to investigate the use of antihypertensive agents to prevent strokes. The aim of the trial is to examine whether these agents stop strokes as well as lower blood pressure in patients with no history of heart disease.\nAntihypertensive drugs are commonly used", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30.

Write a 3-4 page paper in APA format, outlining 3-5 points that you consider needed for both your employer and the nursing staff. Include the following details:\n1. The purpose of the exercise. This paper should address the following points:\na) How should the recommendation be implemented in the workplace to ensure that it is easy for the employee to implement? Give specific examples\nb) An illustration of how the recommended recommendations would help the individual to achieve success in the workplace? Explain this with specific examples.\nc) Discussion on barriers to implementation\nd) How the recommendations would encourage communication between the employee, client/healer, and the client/client?\nf) Recommendation in regard for the patient.\nExample #1: Research Recommendation Paper\nThe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommends exercise as the method of treatment to patients with coronary artery disease and other risk factors. One 2003 study showed that 30 minutes of moderate exercise per day for at least half the week improved heart disease risk factors and improved blood pressure and the ability to walk. 3. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limiting sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs; 1 or more per day) to be consumed on an empty stomach. This recommendation is supported by multiple studies showing obesity or prediabetes in children can be prevented when sugar-snacking is limited to mealtime (19). When possible, limit soda soda to serve only as a table beverage or small amount for lunch or dinner. In short, avoid sugar consumption.\nExample #2: Healthcare Recommendation Paper\nFor a 51-year-old man who has an LDL=4.4 mmol/L and is a smoker (smoker = 12.3 cigarettes per day per week). He is a medical, dental, and fitness enthusiast. Recently, he received a call from a well-known fitness center offering a low-calorie diet. The facility is providing him a diet plan and will likely be a long-term commitment. He wants to have his weight down and fit into a thin waistline.\nYour assignment is to recommend healthy, physically active behaviors for him to follow to help him reach his goal weight.\nThe recommendations (if based on this evidence) would include the following:\n- Stop smoking.\n- Eat fruits and vegetables.\n- Drink water.\n- Get regular exercise.\n- Limit intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (i.e. soda, lemonade).\n- Increase consumption of low-fat dairy.\n- Add fish to his diet, especially in his evening mealtime.\n- Exercise throughout the day rather than during the night.\nExample #3: Healthcare Recommendation Paper\nYou may suggest that your health care professional consult their family doctor if you feel that they are unable to control the risks associated with obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, or high blood pressure as a result of chronic disease (both chronic and acute).\nFor a 65-year-old female who is 20.8 klms tall and a mother, you may recommend that she eat an iron-fortified cereal at least 3 days a week.\nExample #4: Exercise Recommendation Paper\nYou may suggest a 45 min walk several times each week should be sufficient for you to maintain health. Talk to your doctor if you have any other questions or concerns about your exercise activity.\nExample #5: Healthcare Recommendation Paper\nSome health care professionals suggest changing your diet. For that reason, you may suggest adding fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods to your diet.\nFor the", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30.

We recommend you start with a fasting lipoprotein level test for cholesterol. Ask her to take my blood before doing either test and see what she sees later. What is her goal for this test?\nJen: Good question, and I\u2019m glad my question has been addressed. We measure it in 5 parts in a 24-hour period, which means that if you\u2019re weighing 110 pounds, that\u2019s the cutoff point for cholesterol and HDL. Cholesterol is the bad cholesterol that you lose through your diet. HDL is good cholesterol because it helps rid your body of the LDL.\nYou should aim to have your LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol score and triglycerides, triglycerides levels equal or above the cutoff level that you calculate for your patient as part of the first step in your assessment process.\nDo you think this has been successful in preventing or treating some cases of CVD in John?\nI know we\u2019re in a period where I think that this process is far too complex, and I\u2019m so concerned for our patient\u2019s health. I\u2019m worried about the overall progression of cardiovascular disease that the patient is currently going through. My hope is to keep my heart, and in the best interest of John, as healthy as possible. We just hope the results can be shown to help both the patient and the doctors, for whom this patient is being treated. We can\u2019t have a lot of success without good scientific information about it.\nWhat are your next steps?\nIf I think my patient is a good candidate for this treatment protocol, I\u2019d definitely go to the clinic to do some follow up screening, especially for coronary artery disease. I\u2019d go to your local hospital and consult with them to ask you to try some of the other approaches that have been explored in the literature.\nI\u2019d also ask that you talk to my patient a bit more about the cardiovascular approach. For example, I\u2019d like the patient to be willing to ask questions, especially about the role of medication in the treatment of cardiovascular disease and how these medications can help, as well as their side effect profile. Another question to ask is, do you have the best strategies to use in combination with the medications in the treatment plan? I want to let John know that these two things are not the only focus of my treatment. I\u2019d just like to see John\u2019s response to any information that I do have.\nCould you give me the references that John mentioned?\nWe recommend you use the Mayo Clinic reference for screening and diagnostic imaging, followed by the NICE guideline guidelines on CVD.\nThe guideline guidelines cover the following areas: symptoms, causes, risk factors, diagnostic tests, treatment, and prognosis. The guideline also covers the guidelines for non-invasive procedures and imaging, including echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.\nWhy did we choose to publish this as an online clinical guideline?\nTo provide a comprehensive, easily understood and usable list of guidelines on the use of imaging technology and procedures in cardiovascular disease, in addition to providing information about a list of other risk factors and tools to help healthcare professionals take care of patients\u2019 health and well-being.\nWhat is your takeaway that there are very few guidelines related to screening for cardiovascular disease that are published?\nBecause all of these guidelines are available online, there\u2019s not a lot of background information to go by in case you want to learn more about screening. While it may be helpful for you to know that 427 people were found to have cardiovascular disease in NICE-eligible patients, some of these patients may not actually have cardiovascular disease, and others may actually have other health problems.\nIt\u2019s important to know that we also consider what else could cause cardiovascular disease, so this is an opportunity for people to help find other people\u2019s cases too, so this is not our only consideration. There were 65 cases of cardiovascular disease in the study, and of these, 32 were patients who had been diagnosed with an abnormality or a metabolic disease. The remaining 12 were patients that weren\u2019t diagnosed with either problem.

Hypertension in patients with or at the early stage with a combined mortality rate (in both cases) is 1.20% to 1.35% to 2.69% of individuals die, 86% of deaths are preventable.\n- Hypertension is responsible for 50% to 70% of premature death among individuals under 65 years [C.

Blood pressure should be assessed every 4 or 6 months. It can help to diagnose, treat, and prevent potentially life-threatening conditions such as heart attack or stroke. [C.

His blood pressure is 114/61 mmHg, and his total cholesterol is 6.7 mmol/L with an HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L. He is a current smoker, does not have diabetes, but has a family history of CVD. John is currently receiving treatment for hypertension and diabetes. John's cholesterol is low (2.0 mmol/L, with LDL cholesterol of 3.7, and HDL cholesterol of 5.7). John has no specific risk factors for cardiovascular disease.\nPredicting death from cardiovascular disease before individuals are identified is a challenge for healthcare providers.\nWhat is the purpose of predictive modeling for mortality?\nPredictive modelling is a method (for example that of calculating an odds ratio and comparing the odds of diagnosis for the two groups) that uses previously observed outcomes that are in fact influenced by current conditions. In many of the world\u2019s diseases, this includes mortality. The outcome of the treatment being trialed can be predicted using the risk for that specific disease for people of the same age and gender (e.g. for cancer, which has a high survival rate). As well as for CVD, predictive modelling may also be used for cardiovascular health and other medical conditions where the likelihood of an event is not known until the end of the research period. Predictive modelling is usually a stage in a clinical trial. In some trials, for example, a randomized clinical trial, predictive modelling may be used together with a patient cohort to determine treatment preferences in patients who have been identified to be at a higher risk of disease.\nWhat are the limitations of predictive modelling? In general, the potential for bias and/or errors is a major consideration. For some models, such as those designed for mortality, one may find that the same set of outcomes predicts different results in people on two different treatments. In such patients, or in patients on certain tests that do not have good repeatability, using the predictive models may lead to erroneous outcomes, with additional potential risks.\nWhat is a risk factor?\nWhen examining potential risk factors for cardiovascular disease, a risk factor is one that increases the chance of developing a disease by increasing its risk. It is important to consider the risk factors for cardiovascular disease for patients on different treatments, including for CVD, for example.\nPredicting mortality may be most effective when there are no known or significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In such patients, using a few variables that may predict mortality may reduce bias. Potential confounding bias is a problem with this approach and should be addressed by consulting with one\u2019s own doctor.\nWhat is a binary response?\nSome clinical outcomes, such as mortality, may be very difficult to predict through a patient-cohort model because the outcomes may change from day to day or month to month. The data that could be obtained in this case may be very difficult to collect and that are also very difficult to predict. Because of this, it is therefore important that any use of predictive modelling be accompanied by a model that can account for this type of variability.\nWhat factors are considered to be important in predicting mortality?\nSeveral independent (and often conflicting) sources have been used to estimate mortality rates for specific disease groups for various cause-specific mortality events. These include mortality, specific disease, and cohort-based data. In this exercise, we will focus on mortality, specifically, in relation to disease.\nIn an exploratory analysis, we will take a patient-cohort approach and look at the individual factors that are associated with mortality (see below).\nIn a hierarchical analysis, we will try to estimate individual mortality rates that combine the characteristics of mortality and a disease-specific mortality event (Mixed-Mortality-Specificity).\nHow do risk factors influence mortality?\nPredictive modelling is helpful for understanding disease pathogenesis and for understanding the relationship between risk factors and mortality, but it also has to be done within a more robust population and more complex data set. The aim is to build an accurate model that accounts for all aspects of complex human disease and life processes that may influence mortality.\nHow do risk factors affect mortality?\nPredictive modelling can be used to create models in which the predictor variables in the model are the factors affecting mortality. The predictor variables are the specific disease or condition that is being studied, and the factors could be lifestyle factors or other variables, such as a doctor\u2019s diagnosis such as hypertension, a BMI or smoking status.\nPredictive models can be particularly useful when using data from health surveys. Surveys generate a large number of questions that may be missing some individuals, for example. By considering the factors from this survey, it might be possible to get a better understanding of the risks and opportunities associated with each individual question.\nPrediction models that are built based on", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30.

His family history is also known to have history of cardiovascular disease and have previously received a CVD stroke diagnosis. He also has a high level of peripheral resistance to circulation, which complicates an active heart condition.\nJohn is currently on the following medications: he sits at home and is doing poorly in school. His daily routine is sedentary, and he often is tired from running to get to school. John is taking one or two antibiotics every day, and the other antibiotics should be stopped for one week so that he can adjust to a meal plan and a gentle exercise program. He is a vegetarian, and has had a heart attack in a month. He is concerned with the possible relationship between increased cholesterol in the coronary arteries and the occurrence of a cardiac event.\n- Determine if the above measures can help John.\n- Conduct a literature review to determine whether diet, exercise, and nonmedication medication use are effective in managing hypercholesterolemia.\n- Prepare a list of lifestyle, dietary, and medication recommendations for John.\nExercise is important for improving dyslipidaemia in any form, but it is particularly important for dyslipidaemias with dyshomography \u2014 an abnormal combination of high and low ratios of fat and protein in the blood. It can also help people with dyscholesterolemia develop a heart-healthy lifestyle.\nExercise provides benefits for all areas of body function. It is particularly effective for people who have dyslipidaemia as well as people looking to improve overall fitness. Regular exercise can be challenging, but it is a highly effective strategy for overcoming dyslipidaemia and improving health-related quality of life. Exercise-related benefits for dyslipidaemia may include a reduced risk of heart attack, lowering LDL to cholesterol ratio and triglyceride, lowering blood pressure, and improving cardiorespiratory fitness. It can also help people to lose body fat and control weight.\nExercise has many benefits for dyslipidaemia, including: improves muscle tone and strength; makes the heart work harder to pump blood; strengthens the muscles in the heart; reduces cholesterol, triglyceride, and blood pressure; helps improve circulation and healing; and increases the body\u2019s ability to burn fat for it. The best exercise to help relieve dyslipidaemia for dyslipidaemic patients is aerobic exercise: it can help reduce cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the blood by increasing the body\u2019s \u201cheart attack response\u201d to the hormone and nutrients in exercise. People who have dyslipidaemia may have a higher risk of heart attack. Regular exercise can help improve cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high triglycerides. Exercise is also beneficial for people with dyslipidaemia because it has multiple benefits for heart and circulation: it can help relax blood vessels, decrease heart rate and blood pressure, and improve blood flow to the brain and central nervous system (CNS). For dyslipidaemic people who are at high risk of heart attack or stroke, including younger and older adults, exercise is particularly beneficial.\nThe benefits of exercise in dyslipidaemic patients can include:\n- Decrease the risk of major health complications, such as heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease.\n- Reduce the risk of diabetes and obesity.\n- Prevent or delay the onset of other medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes.\n- Improve brain circulation.\n- Control weight and obesity.\n- Improve insulin function.\n- Improve sleep and sleep hygiene.\n- Increase energy and mental well-being.\n- Improve the body\u2019s ability to fight off illnesses, such as infection and diabetes.\n- Reduce symptoms of pre-hypertension and high levels of triglycerides.\n- Lower blood pressure.\n- Lower blood cholesterol levels.\n- Improve cardiovascular function.\n- Improve muscle and nerve function.\n- Lower blood calcium levels.\n- Increase physical activity.\nExercise can help dyslipidaemic patients achieve better cardiovascular health for a more active lifestyle. The benefits of exercise include:\n- Lower blood pressure and heart rate.\n- Reduce the risk of hypertension (high blood pressure) and heart disease.\n- Improve cholesterol levels (blood lipid profile).\n- Control weight and obesity.\n- Manage diabetes.\n- Maintain healthy glucose levels.\n- Increase activity levels.\nWhat Else You Need to Know about Exercise\n- Aerobic exercises are the primary types of exercise recommended for dyslipidaemic patients.

A\n2.) B\n\n*\n\nI've done all three questions, and one still doesn't seem to be in the correct column.\n\nI'd appreciate a solid answer to this question.username_1: I'd take L10 for the minimum, since my data for that time period is skewed towards the low end. However, it seems like there was a big difference in BMI between the high and low points in my data.\n\nThe NICE guidelines is based on the assumption of an identical population across all ages. As a result, your data is skewed towards the early years. If your data is for one study group, it's likely the actual population at that study group would fall somewhere in between your hypothetical population, but if the researchers sampled the entire population, this estimate would probably be larger than what you estimate just from your data.\n\nFor instance, let's say an older person (from the 70s to the mid-sixties) was chosen. He or she would weigh and measure 750 g and fall in line with your data, but as the data shows, 12 year old boys weigh 650 g and fall in line with the same data. Now let's say you are studying them, and find them as being 116 years old. However, the median BMI for one study group is 26. That means our two 1960s boys are between 170 and 196 years old based on their data.\n\nSo in this situation, L5 should be lower, because if your data is not for all 116 year olds, this doesn't hold.\n\nI'd be curious to know which percentile/density data you have - I think that if your study population is not 170 or 180 based on your sample data, your data shouldn't be lower than L5. However if the data isn't based on the study population, my theory is you should consider anything smaller than L5 as the right population.\n\n3.) L 17\n\nYour age estimation looks fine here as 17 is a much younger age range. However, in a study population of 116 people, that would be L10 since the data does not include 100 people in the middle, but only 116 in the whole. To use a different model to evaluate your data, you should use your data and consider if your sample size is larger or smaller than what's provided in the data.\n\n4.) L 20\n\nThere is a large difference between your age and L10, since it's a small study.\n\n(Sorry, I've just been working on a dissertation, so I can't provide the raw data for the younger and older groups, but the data is from your 8th year of medical school, so I will just assume it's between L10 and L11. I'm guessing that if you're looking for a midlife-type of BMI range, the other two look fine.)\n\nAgain, your data needs further analysis to determine what percentile/density your data should fall into. For example, if someone weighs 56 kg and they are 17 years old, they are likely to be a 20 or 25, while 11 year old boys are likely to be a 23 or 31 kg. In this case, your data should be L10.\nUpvotes: 1 username_2: It's best to do this in a spreadsheet such as this one, and then do some statistical analysis on it.\n\nI use the \"SAS\" programming language, but you could equally run it on the Mathematica software or do some basic statistical analysis in your own calculator.\n\nBasically, I'm asking the data quality question of \"how do you interpret data\" or, as the question you phrased it, \"how do you interpret mean and standard error?\"\n\nThe mean is something that you measure in a physical laboratory and is calculated as average, but in this instance, you are not looking at a physical laboratory average in this question, and you are instead looking at a measure of the entire universe relative to that average.

What is the probability of developing diabetes through a random 14-year age-matched cohort group over a 5-07 year period in such a cohort?\nI think the calculation would be for a normal life-shortening (GLM) model. Given your profile, would the model give a 5-year CVD incidence rate with a total risk of 0 (for instance, no risk of CVD):\nYour total risk = 0.5 x 205 = 100.\nBased on your analysis, you will likely have a risk of 0.76/s of CVD. Given that your BMI is low, your risk will increase by 1.27/50 +, which means you are at risk in 17/50, not an actual risk in the future. There are several other factors with no influence on his risk in the future, such as having diabetes, smoking, and family history. The model is valid in any cohort with a group of persons that is the same size as the sample size and the group of individuals is the same size as the sample. What can be stated is that if a person is of the same age, then the model assumes the same probability of being at high-risk at the ages, so the 5-year CVD incidence rate is 0.76 / 50 + of population at 50, assuming that the cohort has a group of people that is 50 years old and have a normal life-shortening curve.(A normal life-shortening curve is one with an age distribution that increases for men and decreases for women.).\nAs an example, let X be the number of women who have had 14, and 2016.

It considers all people, including Chinese individuals without diabetes, with a normal BMI and normal cholesterol levels.\nThe guidelines were created by NICE and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), with input from clinicians. Their aim is to reduce disparities in diabetes and CVD deaths in China. However, NICE does not recommend specific therapies, or specific foods and weight loss programs, for those with diabetes.\n2. It considers the same person as it would for people with diabetes or CVD.\nA clinical trial could be done in countries with either Chinese or CVD populations.\n3. In particular, it will consider how dietary interventions may be modified to the Chinese population.\nThe National Heart Lung and Blood Institute/NHLBI report on nutrition guidance for Chinese people has recommendations for changing nutrition to better meet the Chinese population's needs.\nThe report also states that patients are advised to avoid sugar alcohols such as maltitol and sorbitol and \"soothe the gastric mucosa by providing carbohydrates, fibre, vitamins and essential fatty acids.\"\n4. It assesses dietary patterns by identifying key foods that are the same in the Chinese and healthy Western countries. Its findings are presented in the following table:\n|Low Fat||High Fat||Unhealthy (200 g)|\n||Unhealthy (30 g)||Healthy (50 g)|\nThe high fat diet of healthy Canadians, for example, is recommended. The NHLBI has produced guidelines on healthy weight-loss tips that include eating meals that include fat in the main part of the meal and the exception being fatty foods during special occasions.\nThe US dietary guidelines should include low fiber and high glycemic index foods like whole grains, cereals, breads, and pasta that are easily digested but cause a rapid rise in blood sugar.", "Considering John's demographics and health status - a 70-year-old Chinese male, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, free of diabetes, with a family history of CVD - what would be the NICE CVD guidelines applicable to him?

In all cases the patient must be advised to stop smoking, including nicotine replacement therapy or other such intervention as advised by health professionals. The NICE guidelines suggest, in general, that medical practice should be 'focused around prevention with emphasis on reducing the risk of new coronary heart disease'. The guidelines recommend further examination for cardiovascular disease and its complications - such as 'hypertensive crisis and acute coronary syndromes' should be considered in any patient with 'cardiac, pulmonary, biliary, renal or neuroarterial disease'.\nThe guideline area does not recommend for particular therapeutic strategies but will refer to the patient's condition as a pre-condition or a pre-problem - that is, a condition that may cause a risk to their CVD or heart disease, and which should be managed through the application of preventive cardiovascular and cardiovascular risk management measures.", "Considering John's demographics and health status - a 70-year-old Chinese male, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, free of diabetes, with a family history of CVD - what would be the NICE CVD guidelines applicable to him? Do not forget - there is no standard of care - 'if you get the results available and the guidelines are applied, they can be applied to him and he can manage his health.'\nA few days after the consultation, John needed to get his blood done again. He was 19 years old. This time, he was on a heart drug, Imanidil, he was having a major episode of nausea and vomiting. He had suffered from that for 12 months after he had taken the drugs, which I am not certain of. He was fitter than when he did get his medication. There was one question \u2013 was this drug suitable. I was surprised because he was fine during the intake of he drug and he had 2 weeks of good heart and lungs activity. Would the drug have been suitable for that? I was able to get a blood test results. When asked about his medical history \u2013 John told me that of course he has high cholesterol and hypertension. The most they can find regarding this is age \u2013 at 30, age 67, with no family history of CVD, his age is between 66 and 67. Then I decided to look up the ICD10 codes for hypertension and dyskip (which means heart failure). Then I found the patient in the clinic in Glasgow. When I had asked, he said he was 78 years old. He had a 200/250 mm Hg T8. He was in heart failure, with hypertension, and had heart attack. What was the NICE guideline for this patient?\nOn the other hand, there is another patient, a 24-year-old woman, whom John was referred to him. They went to his GP and they came to the same conclusion. If he has hypertension, he may get A-Level tests done. But, the reason for it is that he is in heart failure. I then recommended this for him because of the low haemoglobin. What is the NICE CVD guideline for this patient?\nThis is a very important topic. We are not familiar with the details of this patient to make any judgement. In this case, I would say in the UK, hypertension is a silent disease. There are no simple but clinically effective treatment options. We are trying to identify all the major risk factors for CVD and these guidelines can be applied to John to help him manage his health. With this, the NICE guidelines for this patient may apply to him.\nJohn, what would you recommend to a patient of your age, who is suffering from a long-standing medical problem or is at risk of cardiac disease?\nI would recommend a person who has a medical history of heart failure. I recommend someone who is currently on heart drug, or has been on heart drug for some time. I would recommend one or more blood tests, especially those that measure the lipid content, especially the low density lipoprotein (LDL) which is the bad cholesterol. A very important area which can help people who are at risk of heart failure, is if they have diabetes, because they are already hypertensive. With a very low Hb is a perfect guide to determine if someone has heart failure.\nJohn had been on a high dose of sulphonamides for six months, and he has also had an elevated lipid profile. This prompted me to do some of the blood tests, to investigate whether he is at risk of heart failure. I would recommend him to have a baseline lipid profile, and when it is high, then have it monitored over a long period of time. This will enable him to know whether he is at risk of heart failure.\nThis can be helpful to you patients who are at risk of heart disease if they are already taking a medication for that, as well the normal part of the cardiovascular disease, which has been going on for too long. It is good to consult your GP because there may or may not be a family history of CVD.\nIt is very important to be aware of the patient picture of coronary heart disease.\nIt is very important to be aware of the patient picture of coronary heart disease, because that can affect your practice in many ways. It is also important to be aware, that the patient may be aware of the heart disease without taking action on it. It is important, that you recognise all that, that is the point, which has to be understood about it, that it is a problem, not a problem which happens in one day or over a few days, and that should be well managed.\nThere is a great need for", "Considering John's demographics and health status - a 70-year-old Chinese male, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, free of diabetes, with a family history of CVD - what would be the NICE CVD guidelines applicable to him? - if yes, how do I understand and use the findings from the NICE CVD guidelines in my practice?\nA 55-year-old Japanese woman with age 49 years was referred for heart transplantation due to her age and general well-being.

She was admitted to intensive care unit. She had a very high heart rate. In addition, she had been prescribed heart medication with no good results. Her systolic and diastolic pressures still exceeded 125 and 80 mm Hg respectively. She was told to undergo cardiopulmonary bypass or has a procedure for coronary stenting.

In the following table, 'T1' and 'T2' are the primary diagnoses made from the X-ray records and 2 'T3' are the two categories of the same disease.\n\n##### T1\n\n\"T3\"\n\n##### T1\n\n\"T3\"\n\nAn X-ray radiograph is a visual representation of X-rays. They typically show an image.\n\nThe following table summarises our analysis, and its implications.\n\n##### T2\n\n\"T3\"\n\n##### T2\n\n\"T3\"\n\nAn X-ray radiograph is a visual representation of 'X-rays' A. X-rays typically reveal structure and provide a good image of the body or area of interest, and are used in a variety of purposes such as diagnosing disease or locating a fracture.\n\nThe following table summarises our analysis, and its implications.\n\n##### T3\n\n\"T3\"\n\n##### T3\n\n\"T3\"\n\nAn X-ray radiograph is a visual representation of \u2018X-rays\u2019 B. X-rays usually reveal structure and provide a good image of the body or area of interest, and are used in a variety of purposes such as diagnosis, locating a fracture, detecting early signs of cancer or detecting abnormalities in the body.\n\nThe following table summarises our analysis, and its implications.\n\nAs the above table of 'T3' data reveals, patients with higher T3 values tend to have more complex problems and may have to do with 'X-rays' C. In these cases the X-ray radiograph may be less revealing than a normal image.\n\nIt may therefore be possible to treat a 'T3' condition as being a'special kind'' of 'X-ray' D. It should be possible to treat the 'T3' condition as a'special kind' of x-ray, especially when the radiographer determines the patient's T3 'value' correctly.\n\nTo apply the T3 'rule', we should:\n\n1. Remove T2 and T3 from the table as we move backwards to find the patient's T2 value.\n2. If no T2 is identified, replace it.\n3. Repeat steps 2 and 4 using the 'T1' table to see if the picture becomes better.\n\n### 2.4.4\u00a0Clinical reasoning\n\nIn this section, each of the above are discussed and illustrated using the following example:\n\n#### Question 4\n\nThe patient lies down in a well-lit room, and his radiograph shows a series of darkened areas near the centre of the photograph. The radiographer suspects that the patient might have developed a severe arteriovenous malformation in the carotid artery, which can lead to carotid artery dissection.\n\n#### Question 5\n\nFor any individual patient with an increased risk for vascular disease, it may be prudent to seek an invasive investigation into the causes of the disease. However, many of these conditions do not result from an inherited vascular disorder, but may result from other causes, such as vascular disease. In those patients who have a family history of vascular disease, a further diagnostic investigation is often required to ascertain that the disease's cause was a genetic abnormality, which is often not detected until after the vascular problems have already developed.\n\nThe table below illustrates the steps of the 'Geneticist' test to rule out a hereditary vascular disorder of the carotid arteries or to exclude vascular disease as a cause of the patient's vascular disease.\n\n#### Question 6\n\nThe first rule of the geneticist is that for any individual patient, a patient would need to be aged 15 to be considered to have inherited the condition. However, the patient may have lived to be 65, so this might not be the appropriate age for the assessment.\n\nIn this situation, it may be appropriate to refer the patient for a'screening procedure' to find out whether they may have a more serious cardiovascular problem prior to making a decision", "Considering John's demographics and health status - a 70-year-old Chinese male, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, free of diabetes, with a family history of CVD - what would be the NICE CVD guidelines applicable to him?", "Considering John's demographics and health status - a 70-year-old Chinese male, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, free of diabetes, with a family history of CVD - what would be the NICE CVD guidelines applicable to him?\nWhich condition would cause high blood pressure on account of his heart disease profile?\nWhat is the difference between systolic pressure and diastolic pressure?\nDescribe what the Framingham Heart Study measurements revealed on 2619, 5743 and 11135 men who had a mean age of 37.9.\nWhich type of pulse wave is most likely to be produced on average by the heart during a healthy adult male sitting at rest and which will be recorded for all age-groups?"], "2": ["Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him? The NICE guidelines state there are four types of cardiovascular risk factors: physical inactivity, smoking, excess weight, and high blood pressure.\nWhat kind of medications can help patients with cardiovascular disease?\nFirst of all, let\u2019s take a moment. If this is your first time talking with a doctor about your cardiac medical history and medication needs we can work together to develop an individualized, medical care plan for you. When talking to our patients this is what happens:\nThe doctor will help you decide if certain medications will help treat your condition; to identify those that are not effective and prescribe other medications. We will work with you to create an exercise program to help strengthen your cardiovascular system.\nAs mentioned before, lifestyle modification is very important to help prevent cardiovascular disease. Some interventions can help you achieve health goals:\nThere are various heart, brain, and exercise programs in our office which we can help you find and stick to.\nA number of cardiac medications will be prescribed when a patient suffers a sudden heart attack, is high blood pressure, or suffers from a low BMI or is in the elderly population.\nMedication used to fight hypertension and high cholesterol includes medications such as: calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, sodium-channel blocker and beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and certain diuretics.\nSome medicines for treating high blood pressure include diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and spironolactone.\nIt is important that the patient is aware of any lifestyle modification strategies they will have to work out and perform on their own. Once established, exercise will often prevent heart attacks and improve blood pressure levels.", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\nThe NICE guidelines are based on a meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials looking at heart disease risk factors in men and women with high blood pressure and diabetes. The results of these trials indicated that increasing the intake of a combination of potassium, magnesium and choline (a precursor to folate) is one way to lower blood pressure. The guideline recommends that a diet high in potassium (more than 400 mg per day) is an important way to decrease blood pressure (72). This can be achieved by combining fruits, vegetables with low fats and high protein foods, such as egg whites, nuts, and seeds, which have high levels of potassium. It is also important to eat more seafood, which is high in folate.\nIn conclusion, when we talk about prevention of CVD, we need to be talking about diet. It should be included in the plan of our patient with high blood pressure and diabetes. It is not just enough that we give him fresh foods, if he has high blood pressure and diabetes, we must also give him a good diet. Because of all the research studies carried out in support of the above guideline and that it has been found, it is obvious that with the guidance of this guideline, we have reached a better understanding of the importance of nutrition in the prevention of cardiovascular disorders.", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\nFor John's height, age, blood pressure, estimated cholesterol level and type of heart disease, it is calculated in the NICE guideline.\nFor heart-related risks for heart disease, the main thing is the risk of heart attacks and strokes, so there are two things:\n- High blood pressure in women\n- Tobacco use in men\nFor all of these reasons, the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention follow the recommendations of cardiovascular diseases, such as the guidelines of the European Organization for Cardiovascular Research for 2005, recommended by the World Health Organization.\nWhat NICE guidelines for cardiovascular prevention for the UK?\nNICE has no specific recommendation for preventing CVD in the UK, but it recommends that:\n- High cholesterol should be reduced by around 5%, so that all people have a normal blood pressure\n- The ratio of triglyceride levels to cholesterol levels should be checked more regularly\n- All people over 40 years old who have a high blood pressure should get their cholesterol levels checked at least once per year\n- The number of people taking blood pressure medication should be calculated regularly based on the risk for myocardial infarction, and should be at least once per year\n- People not in good condition, such as those with chronic liver disease, heart failure, a high blood pressure and diabetes, should be encouraged to get regular check-ups.\n- People with a family background of CVD, especially those from the 25-35-year age range, should consider screening at every check-up\nWhat do the guidelines suggest for a person with prediabetes or impaired glucose regulation (Pigeon)\nHere is the NICE guideline for prediabetes. The guidelines suggest a person who thinks they might have prediabetes, need a medical inspection and a test, and have a lifestyle-change programme to find out whether or not their test results are good, after which they can take action.\nIt also recommends that at least one person, particularly during the pre-prandial meal, and an hour before the examination, those with a body mass index of 40 or more should follow a different lifestyle (a diet and exercise plan) as recommended by the doctor\nWhat the guidelines say for the UK?\nThe advice in the NICE guide says that all people in the UK over the age of 40 should get a blood test for high blood pressure (known as a fasting lipoprotein profile with or without diabetes 2 weeks after having a period of 10 days) at least once every four years.\nThe NHS guidelines for people with diabetes have a similar approach as the guidelines in the UK.\nWith prediabetes, for the most part, people should have an increased intake of fruit and vegetable because it may reduce their risk of some diseases. Fruits and vegetables with the same types, for example orange juice for example, can be consumed in various ways, although at the same time the NICE guideline suggests reducing sugars/fructose in fruit juices and reducing fat/saturated fat for people with a BMI of 30 or above.\nOther healthy lifestyle changes include losing weight, exercise in your free time, and reducing the amount of salt you get from your meals\nWhat health advice do the NHS and NICE have for people with the disease?\nThe NHS has a separate guideline, which recommends the following things for people with diabetes to follow:\n- Don't smoke\n- Get regular and moderate exercise\n- Do weight control if you carry excess weight\n- Quit smoking\nThe NICE guideline also says that people with or without the disease should be counseled on healthy living, which includes diet and weight control (or a reduction of fatty food and increase of fibre intake) and exercise (or a reduction in time spent sitting)\nDoes the NHS's guidelines say there's a higher risk in a lot of countries?\nIt is true that the NICE guidelines are concerned with diseases and conditions that affect the entire population, such as diabetes.\nHowever, despite some of the suggestions like lowering the risk of CVD, and improving the lifestyle of people with a high BMI, it's often not at the point where doctors give clear recommendations.\nThe NHS guideline says the main reasons people develop a heart disease are a lot of diseases such as:\n- High blood pressure\n- Chest pain\n- Coronary artery disease\n- Kidney disease\n- Liver disease\n- Respiratory disease (including cystic fibrosis)\n- Eye disease (cornea and vision)\n- Sleep disorder sleep apnoea (hypopnea)\n- Other causes of heart attack,", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\n- A person with a BMI (Body Mass Index), blood pressure, cholesterol, and total cholesterol of more than 100, fasting sugar of 54, HbA1c of 5.6%, HbA1c of 9.2%, fasting blood sugar of 916 mg/dL, 17-year lifetime smoking history of 39, and hypertension of at least 140/90 mmHg, is considered as high risk, although BMI does not constitute a risk as high as total cholesterol. Screening should begin at 45 years old, so a 140/100, HbA1c level should be obtained by a blood test by the age of 65 years. The following information should be presented to the patient, including the following:\n- The primary health problem\n- Family history\n- Blood tests\n- The patient should be screened only on regular blood tests and blood pressure checks.\n- What are the health problems associated with the person? Is the person not overweight? Whether he/she has diabetes mellitus? Is there evidence of atherosclerosis present?

Is the person's blood pressure at its highest after the intake of glucose or insulin?\n- No diabetes. Does the person have a family history of heart failure or heart failure (which increases the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases)?\n- No history of high blood pressure. Is the person's blood pressure at its lowest after the intake of glucose or insulin?\n- No history of high blood pressure. Is the person in good health, including the presence of hypertension, or are they at high risk of cardiovascular disease?\nB. Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease\nA person should be diagnosed with a disease with a high degree of risk. Risk factors are anything that increases the likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease. Smoking and hypertension are the two risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, respectively, which can be monitored and controlled.\nSmoking increases the risk of heart disease. Smokers experience a 19% increase in the risk of heart disease. A person who smokes has a 15.6% increased risk of heart disease. Moderate to heavy smoking can induce the release of a certain amount of endoplasmic reticulum enzyme (ER stress) which can reduce the activity of a specific type of cholesterol. The amount of cholesterol the person can inhale can be increased by the removal of excess cholesterol from the lungs and/or the removal of blood sugar.\nPeople who smoke are at an increased risk of stroke. The major risk factor for a stroke is having a heart attack or having a heart attack after having another stroke. In addition, smoking increases the risk of heart failure. Although the exact cause of heart failure is unknown, it may be related to insulin resistance due to an altered metabolism of insulin. People who smoke have a 9.54% greater risk of developing heart failure that those who used tobacco.\nThe body of a person who smokes has a tendency to accumulate fatty deposits called plaque, which is harmful to the heart and cause heart attack. Smoking also damages the walls of the blood vessels. As a result, blood flow through the arteries becomes slower, oxygen deprivation occurs in the body, and damage occurs to the cardiovascular system.\nAccording to studies about cardiovascular disease, long-term smoking can permanently block the arteries and decrease the ability of small arteries to supply blood to the heart and other parts of the body. The heart slows down and the heart muscle weakens. Moreover, a person's blood pressure rises, and the blood vessels in the neck stiffen. It also increases the risk of heart failure or heart attack.\nA person who smokes is at an increased risk of congestive heart failure. This is a condition that can be associated with heart failure which is manifested by heart failure, an excessive blood volume, and an excessive volume of blood with decreased efficiency of the heart muscle, which leads to shortness of breath and fluid backing up in the lungs. The fluid buildup and a reduced amount of blood in the blood vessels results in kidney failure. Smoking may also increase the risk of cancer, which is due to damage of the cells that make up the lining of the blood vessels.\nThis can be prevented by quitting smoking. However, tobacco was never intended to be smoked by", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\nThe patient is a 72, 78.5-year-old male (Figure 1) who is a \u201cpredominantly male\u201d and has no known cardiovascular disease.

The epinephrine dose was adjusted to a half therapy of 0.8 mg/kg/hr (pediatric dose 1): 0.8 mg/kg/hr followed by 1.8 (2 days) units per 2 hours until a change to 0.8 mg/kg/hr followed by a repeat evaluation at 15 min; this time interval was determined to be the target to avoid an abrupt escalation of levels. A daily dose of 0.8 mg/kg/hr was also applied as a carbidopa suspension. A 60-g bolus dose (50% at 30 minutes) was delivered intramuscularly and followed by a dose of 1.8 mg/kg/hr followed by 1.6 (4 days) units of carbidopa per 2 hours until a change to 0.8 mg/kg/hr (pediatric dose 1):\n- C700 mg epinephrine (1) : 400 \u03bcM/mg (pediatric dose 1)\n- C800 mg epinephrine (1) : 800 \u03bcM/mg (pediatric dose 1)\n- 2300 mg epinephrine (1) and 5 mg/kg (cGMP)\n- 1 kg (300 \u03bcM) epinephrine (1) and 5 mg/kg (cGMP)\n- A 50 mg epinephrine (1) and 1 mg /kg (cGMP)\n- 5 mg epinephrine (1) and 10 mg/kg (cGMP) followed by 5 mg/kg (cGMP)\n- 125 mg epinephrine (1) and 20 mg/kg (cGMP)\n- 400 mg epinephrine (1) and 25 mg (cGMP)\nEpinephrine infusion was continued once the drug is administered every 6 to 8 h. It is imperative that epinephrine be administered in a timely session or the patient has a rapid change in heart rate which can lead to a heart attack in unrecognised or un-managed patients. The patient is also advised to use intermittent epinephrine, as these are both effective in rapidly elevating the MAP below 7 mmol/L (8\u201315% of body water) in the presence of a myocardial infarction.\nSurgically, the patient has a history of myocardial infarction (heart attack) with 1 non-bruised myocardial infarcted in the heart and a diagnosis of angina pectoris in this hospital. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 119/min. No evidence of pericarditis, myocarditis, or pericardial effusion is present. A 6 mmol/L MAP of 78 mmol/L is also taken.\nEpinephrine has not been given during this patient\u2019s 6 h hospitalization; however, we suspect this is to prevent dehydration and further hypotension which will contribute to further cardiac dysrhythmias, such as ST\u2013troponin I, a major risk, or a hypotension secondary to the administration of a bolus of blood.\nThe patient has received an initial of continuous cardiac pacing. Once his heart has returned to a stable state, we are monitoring vital signs over the next 30 min. Two weeks later he has 2 major arrhythmia complications. These include an episode of atrial fibrillation, which is also occurring in a minority of patients who receive epinephrine.", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\nIt is a complex clinical question, with different approaches to address it. Firstly, the assessment is the simple assessment of the general and specific health related factor, which often include other clinical factors (such as the history of diabetes). For this assessment, NICE considers both the measurement of the general and specific health related factor of the patient group and their risk of CVD. The risk of CVD is assessed based on the definition of CVD in the EHS guidelines (see below). Secondly, with the aim of helping physicians, the NICE guidelines recommend that the person should get a comprehensive risk assessment of CVD, where all co-morbid risk factors are assessed. The NIS of a person does not provide the means for achieving the most up to date cardiovascular risk assessment (e.g., in the EHS model), so some patients may require a more detailed and detailed assessment of the risk of CVD based on the results of individual tests. Thirdly, in addition to the established NIS of the individual patient (e.g., the T2N estimate for the person), the NICE guidelines also suggest a more thorough and accurate risk assessment of CVD that involves the use of blood pressure monitors to measure the blood pressure of a group of patients with CVD. The risk of CVD is assessed using two simple approaches (see Table 1) of blood pressure measurement. The blood pressure measurement of the individual patient is performed by having an individual patient\u2019s blood pressure measured in a single room with their own monitor, which can be a gold standard for patients of this type. To improve the accuracy of the systolic or diastolic blood pressure measurement, the use of pulse wave technology has been suggested. The pulse wave technology is more precise in detecting the systolic or diastolic systolic blood pressure, as well as the T2N estimate of the BP based on the whole blood pressure (12/61 mmHg). (These algorithms differ in the use of the cuff in different countries.) Thus, the systolic or diastolic blood pressure of the patient can be obtained easily without a blood pressure cuff and with low cost and convenience.\nTable 1: Key tools used in the evaluation of individual patients with cardiovascular risk factors\n|The basic tools to assess the risk of CVD||The specific tools to assess the risk of CVD|\n|\u2022 Blood pressure measurement\n|\u2022 Pulse wave technology: the pulse wave technology allows us to measure the blood pressure of subjects without a cuff with the patient\u2019s own monitor in a single room, and has more accuracy and precision in measuring blood pressure than a cuff|\n|\u2022 T2N estimate of the BP based on a pulse wave reading||The T2N estimate of the BP based on a total volume of a cuff from different body parts and the BP measurement of a specific body part (by a different method)|\n|\u2022 T2N estimate of the BP based on a pulse wave measurement alone without the presence of an individual patient\u2019s own cuff||The T2N estimate of the BP based from one blood pressure measurement alone that does not include an individual patient\u2019s cuff|\nAs the following paragraphs show, the NICE guidelines recommend that all the risk factors should be considered on an individual patient basis, and that the methods to measure each individual patient\u2019s risk factors and the methods for calculating the T2N estimate vary according to the type of individual patient (see Table 2).\nTable 2: Methods used by the NICE guidelines for assessment of the risk factors associated with health related factor, and which are most suitable for each type of individual patient by the type of risk factor, the type of individual patient, and the results of the T2N estimate (including the T2N estimate for each individual patient)", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\nAt this point in time, the NHS has guidelines to reduce the chance of developing a stroke/heart attack by 20%. This does, however, include stroke prevention. In an upcoming document, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) looks at the impact on this for coronary heart disease.\nThere is also information on how to reduce the chances of stroke, but you might be wondering: if this is a simple step to take, what about then the risks of heart attack and stroke. You\u2019d think it would be a simple step. Actually, there are a number of different risks involved.\n- For a healthy heart, smoking and high blood pressure are the leading causes of stroke.\n- Cholesterol problems may also be linked to a stroke.\n- High blood cholesterol may increase blood pressure.\n- Hypertension and high cholesterol may contribute to a stroke.\n- Age is a risk factor.\n- People from low-income areas, ethnic groups and people with diabetes are at increased risk of heart disease and stroke.\nIt seems that there are both positive and negative aspects to these lifestyle choices and what is important for stroke prevention is that you do not choose to have a stroke without doing anything else.\nThis would be true if you:\n- Follow a cholesterol and blood pressure and weight management programme to help reduce the risk of heart disease.\n- Maintain a healthy weight.\n- Don\u2019t smoke.\n- Monitor your blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels.\n- Exercise. If you still smoke, do both.\n- Eat a well-balanced diet.\n- Don\u2019t drink alcohol.\n- Try not to eat junk food and sweets.\nThere are also those who think that they don\u2019t have to do anything, and the NHS just said that they could do that. This is not true. You could put a healthy diet, weight management and exercise together and it would reduce your potential risk of heart disease as well as stroke. This advice is taken from the NHS.\nWhile this is obviously an individual level, it also means that for those individuals, a combination of lifestyle and medication may be all that is needed to reduce the risk of a stroke.\nIt is important for individuals to understand that a person with a very high blood pressure and heart attack/stroke is likely to need more of a drug to do something about their heart or brain health, and it is not an excuse to live in denial.\nThere are many more factors involved than just smoking, so that\u2019s why it is important to have other risk factors. There are also some genetic factors in this. Genetics also means that some individuals develop heart disease in a very similar way as others do not.\nIt can also lead to heart disease, but this is not the main disease as you will usually feel the effects afterwards. For example, if you smoke, you may feel the effects of this early in your life. It is a more subtle process to your brain health and some may still have symptoms of heart disease within the later part of their life.\nYou may be wondering at what scale this disease might affect, as there is some evidence to suggest that someone with diabetes and hypertension can have a greater death rate than someone with either of these conditions. This is where it gets complicated. A person could have a diagnosis as \u201cprobably a combination of diabetes [and/or hypertension and diabetes], but they\u2019ve never had a stroke; it\u2019s the combination\u201d. For me, the answer to that is not too far up the line.\nThere is some evidence to show that some types of cancer are also connected to a heart attack. And some people are at higher risk, such that their chance of developing this disease is higher.\nThere is some evidence to suggest that diabetes also increases the chances that you will develop cardiovascular disease, but there are more studies being done. Having a higher risk of getting a stroke and/or heart disease doesn\u2019t mean that you will get the disease, and having a heart attack and stroke doesn\u2019t mean you will have the disease, but it does mean you\u2019re at a higher risk.\nA big part of what you just said, although a bit vague, is that there are other factors that contribute to the risk of heart disease and stroke, even though they don\u2019t seem to have an effect on the degree of risk. Diabetes is one of those factors, but I\u2019m only going to be talking about one, because it has been shown that a high blood pressure and cholesterol and blood sugar levels are related to a greater risk of a stroke", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\nWhat are the most important health factors in promoting the long-term health of a patient? How do they influence the progression of disease?\nA healthy lifestyle is the best preventative measure for CVD and related diseases; it also improves long-term health, but it is important to remember to change the lifestyle before things worsen. The major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases are: a family history of CVD, smoking, obesity, lack of exercise, high blood pressure and high levels of cholesterol in blood. There are a variety of ways to maintain your cardiovascular risk, but lifestyle practices that work better than others are:\nA diet high in cholesterol can cause high cholesterol levels for long-term health\nModerate exercise (can make a big difference), daily weight loss (lowering by 5 kg or 5-6% in 8 weeks), quitting smoking (quitted when possible or you want to start one), eating habits- including moderate or healthy fats, avoiding excessive salt (avoid more if not one) (35 g / day for men), having smaller portions at meals and in snacks (35 g for men) and eating a lot of protein, having less saturated and trans fats.\nReducing your blood pressure (using an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors) as well as your lipids (cholesterol) (Lipid-lowering statins- or niacin) are also very important for your cardiovascular risk. You also need to avoid smoking completely as the smoker has a much lower rate of developing heart disease as compared to those who are at the same risk of smoking. The risk of diabetes also decreases in the absence of smoking.\nWhat is the best advice for treating, preventing and managing CVD:\nFirst, a healthy lifestyle and a well-balanced diet are the best preventive measures. You will also want to work with your physicians on regular blood pressure tests, including LDL and HDL cholesterol. The doctor can also determine which medicines are better for your condition and if they are working at all.\nSecond, as mentioned above, managing your lipid profile and keeping a healthy weight can reduce risk for CVD. But this is a secondary measure.\nLastly, if you have diabetes, you may also need to keep a close eye on your blood sugar levels. Also, if you are in the age group of 35, you may also need to keep in mind the importance of regular exercise to keep your body and your heart healthy.\nThird, a significant intervention for your chronic diseases is smoking cessation.", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\n- Is it possible to reduce a normal person's probability of developing CVD by 20% if blood pressure is below 130/85 mmHg and has a HDL cholesterol of 40 mg/dl?\n- What is the likely cause of high LDL cholesterol or low HDL cholesterol levels in elderly people?\n- What medication for primary prevention is recommended by the NICE guideline on primary prevention of CVD from a long-term perspective?\n- Do you have any questions or have any comments?\nThis question may help in getting your free report on the previous page or here.\nYou can click the following link to be sent to the email address provided: email@example.com\nThis link enables your mobile phone or computers to use the \"Sign In\" button to enter our free reports.

The patient has been through a lot and has never smoked. He lives a relatively normal lifestyle with no diabetes, he has no history of CVD, and he is not currently smoking. The patient has no previous history of dyslipidemia, no smoking history, free of CVD, high total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and fasting glucose. The patient is overweight. The diet is a healthy diet with a variety of carbohydrates, such as beans, whole grains, and vegetables, and fruit intake. The patient has regular physical activity of 60-90 minutes a day; he is not allowed to meet any sport or other daily exercise requirement, which is necessary for his physical activity. The patient has no history of hypertension and no comorbidities. He has no history of hypertension, so the NICE guideline for CVD prevention requires no smoking.\nThe patient's overall age, sex, and height are all in good health and are not increasing any more than he would normally. Also, he has good visual acuity of 20/57 and/or 20/75 and no current medical problem. The patient's HDL cholesterol level is 23 mg/dL and the patient's total cholesterol is 140 mg/dL. The fasting glucose level is 117 mg/dL. The patient's LDL cholesterol level is 100 mg/dL. The 2 other factors that are considered factors are his blood pressure, BMI, and systolic blood pressure greater than 140.5 mmHg. The objective of this study, to determine whether the patient has CVD (blood pressure \u2265140/90 mmHg and serum lipid \u2265165 mg/dL) compared with a baseline healthy weight (BMI 18.5-20.5) man, and his relative risk of CVD was 0.77 (n = 238).\nThe patient underwent evaluation of overall health and visual acuity, and physical activity. A baseline history of dyslipidemia and hypertension is unknown.\nA multivariate logistic regression model was performed to calculate the association between blood pressure (BP) and total cholesterol (TC) in this patient.\nThe multivariate logistic regression model of the 95% confidence interval results showed that BP was associated with total cholesterol (P < 0.001) and with HDL cholesterol (P < 0.001), while TC was associated with HDL cholesterol (P < 0.001). When controlling for sex, the overall ratio of systolic BP to total cholesterol for BP was 53.5, and there was no significant association between systolic BP (P > 0.5; 53.23; n = 238) and TC (P > 0.5).\nIn conclusion, the patient is overweight, has history of CVD, high blood pressure, and high total cholesterol, and has been through excessive physical activity. His LDL cholesterol level is high. As well, he has high TC and high BP. The study indicates that the patient has high blood pressure and obesity.

(A young adult should have the following numbers.)\n\u2022 60 to 64 years in 2013-14\n\u2022 65 to 69 years in 2013-14\n\u2022 70 years or older in 2013-14\n\u2022 75 to 84 years in 2013-14\n\u2022 85 years or older in 2013-14\n\u2022 >90 years in 2013-14\n\u2022 90 years or older in 2013-14\n\u2022 > 91 years in 2013-14\n\u2022 >95 years in 2013-14\n\u2022 >0 years in 2013-14\n\u2022 <3 years in 2013-14\n\u2022 Children less than 5 years in 2013-14\n\u2022 Pregnant women in 2013-14\n\u2022 Breastfed women in 2013-14\n\u2022 Older people in 2013-14\nAnd we also have some data on people over age 64 in 2013-14.\nFor most of us to be in that \"age bracket\", we would need to have reached age 65 or have a cardiovascular event, such as a coronary heart disease or stroke. But that's hard to guess because we know that we're all growing older, which could lead to the same type of results.\nSome people are even in the \"age bracket\" for heart disease, where they have no risk factors for CVD, such as smoking and high blood pressure, but it's hard to say how close someone is to being in \"optimal\" risk because it's hard to know how close someone is to getting a CVD event just by looking at risk factors and heart disease statistics. In contrast, most people think the \"healthy\" population in a \"healthful\" society are in the \"healthcare\" category, which means they're likely to have a heart risk factor, but not know there are enough people between them and their heart rate to actually be in the \"heart\" category.\nSo this is why we need \"risk calculator\" like these. They show you what 90-year-olds (2013-14) should be looking for in terms of risk factors and CVD risk. There's no way to say if someone is in \"optimal\" risk, because this calculator does not allow anything other than people's age and gender.\nI would also like to ask: What are your own personal risk factors for a given age? If I want to stay in \"healthful\" status because I've not had a CVD, will I need to follow these age ranges in order to be in \"optimal\" risk?

What am I eating now and doing now, and what's my cholesterol?\nMy mother is a 65-year old male with no history of heart disease or high blood pressure. Her age does not appear to fit the typical \"healthy\" age category, so I would recommend that she follow these age ranges in order to be in \"optimal\" risk. (A 75-year old male does not fit within this category, but his risk factors for high cholesterol and high blood pressure might reflect a slightly higher risk.)\n\u2022 60 to 64 years\n\u2022 65 to 69 years\n\u2022 70 to 84 years\n\u2022 85 to 94 years\n\u2022 95 to 104 years\n\u2022 105 to 114 years\n\u2022 115 to 124 years\n\u2022 > 130 years\nIt's very important for everyone to be healthy, regardless of age, and many health organizations have guidelines on what is considered healthy for a certain age group.

Please indicate the approach taken, as well as the benefits versus risks.\n- The guidelines (9th session) for CVD prevention (which we believe is being implemented in most China in the time frame of a few weeks)\n- What is the clinical importance and what are your recommendations for prevention of CVDs?\n- Do those guidelines have the same impact as the NICE guidelines?\n- How many years per year does the person need to take the recommended steps to reduce his/her burden of CVDs?\n- What other recommendations do clinicians have for treating CVD?\n- What other recommendations do you have for your patients?\nWe are here to help you determine how these types of NICE guidelines impact your patients.\n- The clinical impact (current medical status) of the NICE guidelines is to improve on the patient-directed approach\n- Recommendations from NICE (from the 9th session), for CVD prevention (if the interventions are implemented today)\n- For patients at the 2nd session, recommendations from NICE (from the 9th session), for treatment strategies for CVD (can include risk calculators and risk categories).\nIt has been known for some time that some medications have an ability to increase the risk of a cardiac event, and/or can be an effective treatment tool for them. That is why it is so important to get the most accurate information about the medications you are prescribed (including other options that they might have).\nTo provide the most accurate information, it is very important to get the most of what the NICE guidelines say.\nThe only way to know what it is that those guidelines advise are a clinical examination, blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate, and/or body mass index. It is also important to know if it is the drugs or other types of medication that you are using that is causing these risk factors for one or more CVD events.\nThe NICE guidelines also give advice to clinicians on prescribing medications to decrease the risk for CVD.\nIn terms of prevention strategies, the best place to start is with the risk calculators to calculate your risk category. The calculators will give you different categories (for example, someone who is high risk or high risk of CVD) and you can begin to look at both factors together.\nIt is very important to be on the lookout for new medications that you are taking, any medications that you currently have, and any supplements you are taking, especially if you are using a tablet.\nIn terms of treatment strategies, you can ask about lifestyle interventions such as diet and exercise to begin with, and as time progresses, these interventions will become more complex and will be covered in the next 9th session.\nIn terms of discussing the most appropriate medication use, first, ask about any medications that you are taking and see if they are approved by the FDA.\nAs an example, if you have been prescribed diabetes medications to help control your blood sugar (which you could do without them just by using them in moderation), you can talk to your doctor about how your medications affect your cardiovascular health.\nThe NICE guidelines may not be as helpful for some of you as it may be helpful for others. So, take the opportunity to get the most accurate knowledge you need about the diseases you may have in your future.\nIf your doctor does not have the NICE guidance (from the 9th session), ask if they have their own guidelines.\n- The NICE guidelines do not recommend lifestyle modifications as being the only way to make positive changes for people with a certain disease.\n- When talking with individuals, you can ask them to share that they are not following a prescribed course of lifestyle modification, so to increase the chance of maintaining a healthier lifestyle, it might be a good idea for them to work with a nutritionist or a registered dietitian to make choices about nutrition and exercise.\nTo ensure that all of the information is up to date, each year the NICE publishes a checklist for clinicians to look at to check that their patients are following the guidelines.\nThe current list is available here.\n- If you are taking medication and would like it checked, it is okay to do a blood test if it shows low blood count markers (low platelet counts) and low red blood (Hgb) values (below normal).\n- If you are using a tablet, you can check it using the NICE\u2019s tablet tracking tool.

In the 10 years since the average BMI for this age group was 31.05,", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\nAnaerobic glycolysis of muscle cells is one of the most important nutrients for muscle nutrition after exercise. Anaerobic glycolysis of muscle cells by anaerobic glycolysis of muscle cells is the only nutrient that occurs in the living body that makes it possible for the muscle cell to burn glucose and other oxidants to supply mitochondria, it is therefore crucial to provide oxidative conditions to muscle tissue. The following foods can support and contribute to the adequate synthesis of aerobic or anaerobic glycolysis in the body:\nBeta-glucans are soluble oligosaccharides containing multiple sugar units in a chain to which various chemical reactions are catalyzed. Beta-glucans are structurally similar to their \u03b1-glucans, the main component of oats, and thus are known as \u03b2-glucans. B-12 is not present in most foods but can be found in certain vitamin C supplements and fortified foods.\nCereals are high in B-12. They are usually whole or fortified. B-12 is an essential nutrient and is involved in various bodily functions such as the production of blood cells and DNA. Deficiency in the body can result in the symptoms of anemia, fatigue, nervous irritability, memory loss and hair loss, and a reduced sexual quality of life. B-12 should be at the top of one's food and drink list.\nWhen choosing foods to eat for your blood sugar level, we often turn to foods that are rich in carbohydrate and sugar. This means that these foods are low in fibre and high in fibre, which contain glucose as a fuel, since this means they will provide energy.\nHowever, one of the benefits of our blood sugar should be your memory. If your blood sugar levels are balanced, this means your memory won't be affected and you'll probably feel your best.\nThese foods can help to regulate blood sugar levels and increase your chances of remembering things. These foods should be eaten together with low-fat dairy products and plenty of soluble fibre. By eating foods that contain both carbohydrates and fat, one can improve their concentration. These foods are rich in fibres that allow you to have a better concentration.\nCereal and meat are also part of carbohydrate consumption. This can help to maintain a balanced blood sugar level and help with memory in healthy people with blood sugar levels below 8 mmol/l (depending on individual circumstances).\nNUTRIENT STRUCTURE FOR BLOOD FOLLOWING LOW-CARBS\nThis means that these foods contain 0.5-1g of carbohydrates per 100g. This can be helpful for your sugar levels and overall wellbeing.\nFoods rich in fibre are important to have for your blood sugar. Fibre lowers blood sugar levels and provides a range of nutrients, and is especially important for those with diabetes. We already know that fibre helps to support the growth of good bacteria in the gut, as well as having a range of benefits on the bowel and liver. Also, fibre helps to maintain and move food in the gut efficiently to feed good bacteria. For people with diabetes, it is important to avoid things such as white flour, bakery products, and juices, so it is better to drink water instead.\nHowever, there are exceptions to this rule. For example, you may want to avoid foods that are high in added sugar. There are two sugars found in sugar, fructose and glucose, so, like other nutrients in foods, we cannot give them a negative credit.\nSugar and food allergies\nThese foods do not cause your blood sugar to rise, although having allergies to them can lead to a drop in blood sugar. Since they contain some sugar, they can cause a short-term spike in blood sugar. However, if the immune system reacts negatively to these substances and responds to them by producing antibodies, the body has a reaction to sugar and blood sugar levels. You are advised to watch these foods and reduce your intake. There are two types of allergies to sugar and foods:\n- a type of allergy caused by a food known as FODMAP. FODMAP is a family of nutrients that exist in many foods. This family includes onions, garlic, bananas, pears, garlic, wheat, soy, lactose and fructose, and is responsible for the symptoms of bloating and gas in some people. The symptoms are exacerbated in the lower part of the gastrointestinal tract, the smaller intestine, for example. In these cases, fructose is most likely caused by FODMAP.\n- a food allergy is when foods interact with an immune system that normally would not react. Like FODMAP, but on"], "3": ["Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\nA. The guidelines recommend a low-dose omega-3 supplement with at least 250 mg of EPA/DHA for a first-line intervention, starting at 200 mg/day on a daily basis. Since blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides levels significantly increase during the winter, it is recommended that the supplement is continued for at least six months.\nB. Several studies have demonstrated that regular fish consumption or EPA/DHA is associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular disease in the Framingham heart study.\nC. Because of the strong association between fish intake and low blood pressure, omega-3 fatty acids are recommended in reducing symptoms of low blood pressure.\nD. The Framingham heart study showed reduced risk of stroke, heart failure, and heart attacks in people receiving higher doses of omega-3 fatty acids compared to those receiving less than 200 mg per day.\nE. It was found that people who consumed more than 600 mg/day of EPA/DHA supplements were significantly less likely to have an adverse heart event than those that consumed less than 800 mg/day of EPA/DHA.\nS. A. The Framingham study was done to determine the association between food consumption and mortality in relation to cardiovascular disease and found that most people in the Framingham study who consumed more than 800 mg/day of EPA/DHA consumed less than 500 mg/day of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, and thus were lower at risk for CVD events. Similarly, the Framingham study found that more fatty fish was the most important sources of omega-3 fatty acids, with the most beneficial form of EPA/DHA being higher EPA/DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids present in most fish are also better known and are derived from cold water fish like sardines, herring, mackerel, salmon and anchovies.\nS. The research shows that a large source of fat, that makes up the majority of fat in your body, is the most important source of fish oil. So, fish oil supplements are best used for people with a heart-healthy lifestyle if you are willing to take the risk, but it is also important that fish oil supplements contain EPA. The best fish oils are obtained from fish that have had their fish oil supplements supplemented with EPA and/or DHA. The safest sources are herring and salmon, although many contain a higher percentage of EPA. However, you cannot rely solely on fish oil supplements to lower the risk of heart disease, so it is important to maintain a lifestyle free of smoking and exercise.\nS. Your general goal in reducing your high blood pressure should be to decrease your blood pressure by 10% or less during your first 30 days in the hospital after treatment. Therefore, you should begin by reducing your blood pressure using the following recommendations:\n(1) Decrease your systolic blood pressure (the top number of your blood pressure reading) by about 1/7th of a point. This step is important for heart attacks and heart disease because elevated systolic blood pressure = increased chances of having heart attacks.\n(2) Maintain a heart-healthy lifestyle by increasing your fruit and vegetable consumption, eating a heart-healthy diet that is low in sodium, and staying on an atkins diet instead of a low-fat diet.\n(3) Reduce your total cholesterol (the number above the lines of the graph of risk) by about 1/8th of a number. This is important because low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or the bad cholesterol is known to raise the risk for heart disease and atherosclerosis.\n(4) Lower triglycerides by about 1/20 to 1/4 point. Since triglyceride is known to raise the risk of developing heart disease, you must reduce your LDL levels and get your triglyceride levels under 70 milligrams per centimeter of thickness.\nS. You should be aware that a combination of a low-fat diet (35 to 36 % of calories for fat) and a 30 to 31% of calories for protein, and an increased intake of fruits and vegetables, are the best ways to achieve or remain at a low, healthy heart-healthy heart weight. These foods, along with low sodium, cholesterol-lowering foods, and high-fiber foods, reduce the number of fatty acids consumed.\nS. Your overall daily sodium intake should be limited to not more than 2000 mg per day.", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\nJohn: Dear, I've been following the best practices of the NICE Guideline for the Screening of High Blood Pressure in Overweight Adults. While John's blood pressure remains elevated, it is controlled within the guidelines, and it's being carefully managed. I would share:\nThe main recommendation is to reduce total blood pressure to 120/80 mmHg. By 2025, John should be under 140/90 mmHg. To achieve these blood pressure goals, we should focus on two things:\n1) Reduce salt intake:\nIn order to meet this target, John should reduce the amount of salt he consumes by less than 5g per day. This would reduce the salt he consumes to about 75g. As a result, John's systolic and diastolic blood pressures would keep within the guidelines of 120/80 mmHg and 90/60 mmHg respectively.\n2) Increase exercise:\nTo achieve these targets, John would have to:\nMake regular and active exercise a priority, including walking, swimming or cycling at a pace that is at or slightly above his normal HR. Not engaging in any routine physical activity over the two weeks (16 weeks) prior to the interview will not achieve these guidelines.\nTo achieve his targets, John's current level of activity would change to an activity at or slightly above his normal HR. For example, if John's level of physical activity is the moderate risk equivalent (MedRisk) at which he will be eligible for 60-300min/week of cardiovascular exercise, he would exercise three times a week. The objective is to gradually increase the intensity and duration of activities, and, if he is unable to do so, to move back to the previous Moderate Risk activity level.\nJohn's level of physical activity would be less than 56% of total weekly activity. This is where you stop. I would suggest continuing to engage in all five hours of moderate physical activity as long as you are able to. My usual recommendation is to continue 10a10 or 5a50 a session. This should help him reach his 2025 targets. I would recommend increasing the frequency and duration of my PE, and/or engaging in physical activity during lunch as well as at home or at workplace (20-30min). I would recommend the same exercise patterns as John and that you are able to do any activity.\nTo achieve his targets, John would then engage in at least 40-60 min of exercise per week as recommended by HCG. This would include a minimum of two to three days of non-exercise activity per week. I would encourage John to spend at least 30min of activity per week in the gym or at home/at work. Once he has gained the 60-300 min/week activity target, he can go to the gym per day with some assistance.\nIn addition to increased physical activity, I will encourage John to reduce the amount of time he spends in sedentary environment. My example is: I would advise John to set a 5-person bed at night and walk around his home 30-40 minutes a day by the time we get to bed. The objective is to create a safe and comfortable environment for him to move throughout the day. At the same time, I would encourage him to go to the gym as soon as possible as this will improve his quality of workout and help to keep his energy level high.\nJohn, for the most part, would be able to do an eight- or nine-person bed. He would be at his usual HR of 120/80 mmHg. I would suggest using the home gym as well as the gym while I is home (10-13min). This is to increase his heart rate to about 150-300msp during exercise and allow me time to catch up to his increased HR increase during the 7-12min duration of the exercise.\nWhen I am at home, I will encourage him to perform simple warm-up exercises such as going for a 15-20min walk around the house, stretching, doing light stretching exercises and doing some light or heavy housework each day.\nFor children, I would recommend introducing exercise into their daily routine. There would be one or two supervised physical activities for them each day, at least 30min per day. The objective is to improve their", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\n1.

While many experts agree that heart health is a critical part of overall health, it is not always easy to identify. The NICE recommendation that everyone should maintain the lowest LDL cholesterol and highest HDL cholesterol levels of 4-5 by 2025 is one element of the NHS's comprehensive lifestyle change strategy to improve heart health. With such a long and challenging life, taking charge of one's health should be something to focus on. While it is likely that many factors such as lifestyle habits will influence the outcome, the NHS guidelines are a solid foundation and the NHS encourages everyone to use it to improve their health and wellbeing.\nDr Tom Chuang, clinical lead and chief clinical officer of the NICE guideline update program, said: \u201cThis guidance outlines some of the common risks to the quality and quantity of the blood, which some patients face on a daily basis. The current focus is on high cholesterol levels, diabetes and smoking. It does not cover everyone or any one type, so it should suit all people who want an understanding to take control of their health now and look after their own health in the future.\u201d\nDr Chris Dickson, consultant cardiologist at the University of Leicester and lead clinician on this guideline update, said \u201cThis guideline will help doctors, teachers and patients to be more self-aware about their health, to identify and assess individual and family risk for disease and help prevent the diseases that most severely impact on their lives. The guide will help patients work with their family, friends and healthcare providers to develop a plan to improve their health. It will also ensure patients are better prepared and equipped to tackle the challenges of a healthier lifestyle.\u201d\nNHS and NICE have launched a new partnership which is designed to bring together NHS leadership and healthcare professional experts to identify new evidence-based strategies to improve patient care and outcomes.\nThe partnership, The NHS Alliance for Improved Care, has developed a strategy to ensure that quality improvement programs such as NHS blood pressure check services in England get extra funding and resources. It is designed to maximise the benefits of a health system that is better placed to manage blood pressure.\nNHS England and NICE collaborated on this work, which will be available before the end of the year. However, the guidance will be more widely used for patients and their health care professionals.\nNHS England has launched a new website, NHS England Action Online, offering information that provides guidance to health professionals, patients, and their families, who want to get more in-depth knowledge about their health and the potential effects of interventions.\nIt is being driven by the NHS Action Online team, which advises employers and healthcare professionals to ensure they meet the minimum performance criteria and to communicate effectively with each other and the broader network on the need for improved outcomes for their staff members.\nFind out more about our new website: https:/ / www.nhs.uk\nFor further information:\nDr Tom Chuang, clinical lead and chief clinical officer of the NICE guideline update program, Tel: +44 1221 442230 or email: email@example.com\nChief Consultant Physician & Consultant in Obstetrics & Gynaecology: firstname.lastname@example.org", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?

He does not have other medical conditions that present an increased risk for CVD \u2013 this could include a history of heart attack or other heart conditions, a tobacco and alcohol use history, or a previous stroke. As he is an ideal example of a general population where CVD risk can be controlled and the potential benefits of a reduced risk of cardiac events in high risk populations are likely to exceed the cost, the decision to terminate his life is an important decision that should be made considering these considerations.\nAs this case study will illustrate, there are different considerations and methods used to address the same problem that are not always equal, and not necessarily the same approaches are applied to this patient.\n- Identify potential comorbidities, conditions or clinical findings that may present a complex cardiovascular risk and how this may affect your clinical decision-making.\n- Identify potential non-cardiovascular risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n- Evaluate your options for treatment for this patient.\n- Develop a collaborative approach with you and your management team to determine the best course of action in this patient\u2019s care.\n- Do not give an opinion; rather, determine the best course of action for your patient according to what your data indicate.", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\nSophie: The National Institutes of Health guidelines are divided into two sections: The most recent guidelines are based on the best available evidence. They are not updated and should be followed. The 2008 American Journal of Cardiology guidelines are updated. This makes it sound like John\u2019s recommendations are better in light of the latest evidence. What exactly does John\u2019s BMI mean?\nJohn: My BMI is a range, 13-19, which will always vary from person to person. We know that there are other potential variations based on sex and age. It\u2019s important that we understand the range of what is likely to be a healthy BMI within the next five years. This is probably a good indication of John\u2019s current state of health. What does it mean when it comes to his BMI levels?\nSophie: For John, my BMI level is 33, which is below the 95% cut-off level for normal weight for the age and sex of the adult. A measure of excess fat was added by the NICE guidelines to the current BMI. If we take the BMI by age and sex into account, this would mean that John is 28.9 kg/m2. This is an underweight individual. This is a potential fall below the 95% cut-off level, if we take the BMI and weight together. John is now 104.9 kg/m2. This is overweight for the age and sex of the adult. If we take the BMI into account, this would be an underweight individual.\nIf the next step is to make a change in lifestyle, like getting more exercise or eating a healthy diet, this would also make a big difference. What will John do if he becomes overweight?\nSophie: It may not happen overnight, but it\u2019s very likely that over time he would lose some weight and get to a healthy BMI. John would be better off within the next five years than if he made a change in his lifestyle when he was younger. John\u2019s BMI would be lower still if he stopped smoking, lost weight and started eating a healthy diet. He would be healthier and have a more stable weight.\nDo we have recommendations?\nSophie: No, there is no set recommendation for the BMI. It\u2019s something worth discussing with the nurse when John is beginning to take their lifestyle and weight management plans, at this point he will decide.\nWhen will we meet with John to discuss his lifestyle and weight management plans?\nJohn: John would be there as this consultation. He would be working with the nurse at least every week until he gets to this point in time.\nAre there any limitations to this consultation and weight management plan?\nSophie: The consultant will be there regularly to discuss the weight. We will have a meeting with him regularly to discuss the weight and lifestyle. This involves talking to him and getting some information so that we can know what we can do to achieve a healthy BMI in the next time.\nI just want to say that the recommendation is that I should start eating healthy and having a healthy lifestyle (i.e., a healthy body and a healthy mind) with John.

A1C is a measure of glycemia and a value to allow identification of risk for development or worsening of diabetes. A1C is used to assess patient response to insulin treatment for diabetes mellitus, and the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, and to compare diabetes among individuals from the same racial group. The average value was calculated according to age group and sex. We used BMI as an indicator of obesity but not BMI as a screening test for diabetes in 2-year-olds. We used WC as a risk measure of obesity and overweight for individuals with type 2 diabetes but not obese.\nWe examined the risk of cardiac disease (A1C and BMI are confounded by diabetes) in 820 children (5-18-years), aged 5-30 years, who were enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2004 and NHANES 2006-2007, 800 adults (1-75-years) aged 50+ years, who were enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2004, and 500 adults.\nThe age and sex distribution for the NHANES 2001-2004 and 2006-2007 is shown in the Table 1. In males, weight was significantly higher than gender in each NHANES 2006-2007, but the BMI trend was similar. There were 1,161 children and young adults (5-18-year-old) in NHANES 2001-2004. The average age was 10.5 years. The age distribution and composition of the groups is shown in the Figure 1. In NHANES 2006-2007, age was similar between groups with boys and girls. In NHANES 2001-2004, the average age was 9.2 years for males and 10.6 years for females.

How much should he use and in what dose?\n- What drugs are available to help prevent angina?\n- Which drugs are available to help relieve chest pain in angina, and can they help John\u2019s angina symptoms?\nIn 2015, the NHS launched the NHS Heart Program in order to treat all patients and provide specialist cardiovascular care. The aim is to make sure cardiac patients are treated as comprehensively as possible \u2013 from heart attacks and heart failure to stroke and heart rhythm problems.\nWhen should John have his cardiac assessment?\n- In order to assess John for the heart condition and help him start his treatment as accurately as possible, he should have his heart, heart function, and blood pressure checked regularly, together with an ECG. The ECG takes measurements of the electrical activity of the heart, which can be used to show the strength and consistency of the heart rate. In addition, the ECG can help identify any abnormalities that require further investigation.\n- John can\u2019t undergo an ECG if he has been diagnosed with a heart rhythm disorder (arrhythmia). That means a non-invasive method for assessing heart rhythm is not practical or appropriate. There is more than enough evidence for John to get an electrocardiogram (ECG).\n- John\u2019s healthcare provider may need to check John if he has symptoms of an abnormal heart rhythm for a cardiac assessment. The heart rhythm problem he has may be related to blood pressure, or the heart does not pump blood as efficiently as it should. The heart rhythm should not get worse as a result of increasing pressure in the blood vessels. This condition is known as bradycardia.\n- If heart rhythm in John deteriorates, he may need a catheterised exercise test. To get to the heart muscle (myocardium) and to evaluate the heart muscle (myocardium wall) to see if there are abnormalities, John may have a Doppler test.\n- If John has symptoms of heart rhythm problems, a cardiac assessment should also be carried out to find out whether he has atrial fibrillation (AFib). This causes irregular and rapid heart beats. AFib can lead to symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, fast heart beats, and shortness of breath. In addition, there is a higher risk of stroke and heart failure.\nJohn\u2019s cardiac assessment\n- Before John starts his ECG procedure, the healthcare provider will ask him if he knows what was previously suspected. John may ask them questions about what they have been doing with John in the past, what it was like for John before, and where John has been for a long time. John\u2019s healthcare provider will be asking about his symptoms and past health and how recent an event or period has been.\n- John can also check whether he is taking medications safely, and whether he is getting enough exercise and medication.\n- John\u2019s health history will be given, or a list of possible diseases that he had before being diagnosed with heart disease will be given.\n- An ECG will be run on John. To assess the heart rhythm problems of John before the procedure, the ECG will be used to show the strengths and the consistency of his normal heartbeat.\n- John needs to get the information you have given from them to start this assessment.\n- Once John has had his ECGs, you can ask some questions to identify possible reasons for his heart rhythm problems.\nWhat conditions were associated with John\u2019s health before he had his ECG?\n- What were the leading causes of the blood pressure problem he had? Were he at risk factors for this condition before he was diagnosed with heart, or with high blood pressure (hypertension)?\n- What conditions led up to his coronary heart disease after it was diagnosed? What medical issues led him to get the disease?\n- Who did John think was in control", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\nJohn\u2019s cardiovascular risk factors identified are obesity, hypertension and diabetes, which together are 50 percent of his total cardiovascular risk.\n\u201cIf we had established a standard, it would have helped John avoid premature events such as strokes and heart disease,\u201d said Dr. Shing Yong, Director of the Heart and Vascular Research Program at the Harvard Medical School in Massachusetts, who is also the Harvard Medical School Physician of the Month.", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\n1.

No physical activity\nThe information in this article will be sufficient for one adult who does not take medications for high blood pressure or for those starting medications or trying to control their condition. It will help to calculate the risks for John\u2019s age range.\nJohn\u2019s Blood Pressure and Cholesterol\nFirst thing first, you should know your cholesterol levels. Coronary heart disease is the most common cause of death in the United States and is generally associated with the number one cause of death in men aged 60-79 years. He is also at risk for developing other diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, or a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (a heart muscle problem). High levels of cholesterol in your body have been known to cause some major health problems. These health problems include heart disease, heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease.\nSome studies have suggested that increasing cholesterol levels raises the risk of contracting some major diseases. Some of the conditions and disease that are associated with unhealthy cholesterol include heart disease, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, diabetes and many others.\nHigh blood cholesterol levels have been associated with the incidence of these serious health problems, according to the research of Prof. Rajendra P. Singh from Indian Council of Medical Research. This research shows that the cholesterol levels were associated with the incidence of coronary artery disease and the incidence of peripheral artery disease in those with obesity. The risk of a heart attack was higher in those with large waist circumference. Furthermore, when the cholesterol level is elevated, the risk of stroke also increases, according to the research.\nWhat is the correlation between high cholesterol and heart disease?\nIt has been proven that cardiovascular disease is associated with high cholesterol levels which increase the risks of cardiovascular disease. This does not take into account other risk factors such as blood pressure, cigarette smoking, alcohol and physical activity levels. So, the first step in evaluating risk is knowing your number one risk factor. This makes for a great decision to know what the next action is in your health.\nHigh cholesterol makes other risk factors such as smoking, physical inactivity and overeating, in fact, higher levels of these risk factors are associated with cardiovascular disease. Now, if you add high cholesterol to other risk factors, then we will start seeing a negative relationship, and even a weak link. In this case, it is wise to ask yourself: Are you overweight, inactive, or are you a smoker? Are your lifestyle habits and genetics, or both, the main causes?\nYour cholesterol values tell cholesterol risk. So, if your blood cholesterol is high, a family history or heredity of cholesterol and a diet in general that is rich in saturated fats is a clear signal. The higher your cholesterol, the higher your risk of cardiovascular disease. So, while there are some risks associated with cholesterol and heart disease, there are all risks associated regardless of your cholesterol levels and overall wellness.\nWhat are the implications of cholesterol?\nThe consequences for this individual are not as acute as other people of common age. This leads to the following:\n\u2022 More frequent visits to a doctor for treatment\n\u2022 Treatment of high risk in medical conditions\n\u2022 Increased insurance costs\n\u2022 Increased insurance premium and medical bills\n\u2022 Improved treatment outcomes\n\u2022 Fewer heart disease events\n\u2022 Less stroke and heart attacks\n\u2022 More work opportunities for the individual\n\u2022 More career opportunities\nCardiovascular diseases are common regardless of a person\u2019s blood cholesterol level. However, when taking into consideration the risk factors associated with high cholesterol and smoking, there is a strong link between high cholesterol levels and the occurrence of these major illness.\nWhich cholesterol lowering therapies will I receive?\nNo study supports that the cholesterol lowering therapies mentioned will cure the individual suffering from cardiovascular disease. This treatment is only designed to lower the cholesterol levels by reducing them to the same range that you will be more likely to need if you are concerned about your cardiovascular disease. In other words, it is a tool to use once you think that you should stop smoking or lose weight.\nBut what does the study find? When you do not use this treatment, you will still be at increased risk of some life-threatening diseases including the following:\n\u2022 Heart Attack\n\u2022 Arterial Thromboembolism\n\u2022 Endothelial Dysfunction\nThese studies have made a direct correlation between heart disease and high cholesterol, so what type of treatment would I have to do to avoid", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\nThere has been some discussion in the literature about the risk for cardiovascular disease in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes (NIID) \u2013 the most frequent reason for diabetes \u2013 and some of the recommendations are quite poor.\nTherefore, our recommendation is that a typical patient for primary care would need to be evaluated for the risk for cardiovascular disease in order to be diagnosed and appropriately managed. In that case, your patient needs to have the patient screened for cardiovascular disease.\nIf a risk assessment for CVD is performed, what risks and potential costs are involved?\nThere are several types of risks to be considered \u2013 the first being the number of risk factors you are concerned about. The fourth is the current level of care you would expect. If you only checked for your personal risk, you would be looking at only one of the other risk factors. This is not appropriate, and you should look at the number of risks that your target group is concerned with. For example, if the target level is 20% for your personal risk, you would be looking at 1 person for your target rate of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. A target level of 20% is acceptable, but not a target level of 30% for heart risk.\nIn most cases, if you are only looking at number of risk factors, you can expect to have 10 to 20 people looking at you for CVD risk every year with 5 to a dozen of them. However, all of these people may be unaware of risk factors. A few reasons include many of them only being aware of symptoms and being unaware of risk factors:\n1) Screening for risk factors has been largely developed over the last few decades, and we need to assess current clinical management for them\n2) In the US, there is a trend towards more preventive screening over time which is generally not possible in the short term\n3) The number of tests is becoming more widespread\nIf screening is to be the focus, then it is important to establish the population you wish to work on, and what the screening is designed to provide. Screening can be done by screening for factors that are routinely included in primary care, such as age, gender, smoking, and body mass index, etc. For example, smoking is considered a risk factor for CVD, but it is common to find that younger adults smoke. Thus, screening for smoking would mean evaluating adults in their 20\u2019s who are interested in getting screened. This would include 10 participants in one of three subgroups: people who met the criteria for CVD, people who met CVD criteria, and people who were not smokers. The other 10 participants are not smokers.\nFor the purposes of this article, the 3 groups I discussed above are all people with 10 to 20 patients who are screened for CVD.\n4) If you have the target group and you are looking at prevention screening only, you need to estimate the amount of age-adjusted risk among this population.\nFor example, suppose the target population has about 3,000 people; one thing to keep in mind is that we already have evidence that smoking affects CHD.\n5) You can work with your primary care provider to set standards based on the results of the screening, and how well they are fitting in with your current practice.\nIf you have been screened, it is very likely that you would not need any further screening.\nHere\u2019s the question \u2013 should your patient be screened for CVD annually?\nThere is no consensus as to the number that should be screened annually for CVD. We feel that individuals should be screened for CVD, in conjunction with cholesterol screening, at least three times a year. We believe that adults should have periodic CVD screening. The reason for this is because most people with a higher risk of risk factors have one or more of the indicators listed for CVD. Typically, this includes people who are:\n1) at increased risk of heart disease \u2013 smokers, people who are overweight or obese, etc.\n2) at current risk for CVD (i.e., older adults, younger adults, etc.)\n3) who smoke or otherwise might be at increased risk for CVD\nMost patients will meet both of these criteria. The first is a greater than 10% increase in the risk for the first group. The second is more than five years for the second group. Thus, you will need to use data from patients who are not smoking and who have an increased to a 10% increase in their risk for CVD (or CVD if", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\n(a) Cholesterol = 5% to a total cholesterol level of 10000mg.\n(b) Heart disease = 50%\n(c) LDL = 50%\n(d) High blood pressure = 30 mm Hg.\nWhat are the most frequent symptoms of heart disease in John?\n(a) Pain in legs, groin, or chest\n(b) Trouble breathing\n(d) Chest pain\n(c) Exercise-induced angina\n(e) Shortness of breath\n(f) Throat pain\n(g) Vomiting and nausea\nWhich of the following is NOT a CVD danger?\n(a) High cholesterol\n(b) Family history of heart disease\n(c) Poor blood circulation\n(d) Obesity due to lack of exercise\n(e) High blood pressure\n(f) Kidney disease and Diabetes\nWhich of the following is most related to hypertension?\n(a) High cholesterol\n(b) High potassium\n(c) High sugar intake\n(d) High salt intake\n(e) Normal BP\n(g) Vitamin C deficiency\nHypertension results in a higher risk of:\n(a) Lung cancer\n(b) Heart disease\n(c) Obesity-Type II\n(d) Pulmonary artery hypertension\n(e) Coronary artery disease\nWhat is the most common type of low blood pressure?\n(a) Hyponatremia; is caused by too much sodium intake\n(b) Hypokalemia; is caused by too much potassium intake\n(c) Hypoparathyroidism; results in low potassium levels\n(d) Hyponatremia; results in low sodium intake\n(e) Heart attack/hypertension due to lack of exercise/hyperactivity\n(2000) Men 50-69 years.\n(a) 8 to 10 lbs.\n(b) 6 to 7 lbs.\n(c) 9 to 10 lbs\n(d) 8 to 10 lbs.\n(c) Exercise-induced asthma\n(e) Diabetes mellitus\n(c) Exercise-induced asthma\nHow does diabetes cause hypertension?\n(a) Elevated systolic (one) pressure\n(b) Decreased diastolic pressure\n(c) Increased diastolic pressure\n(d) Both a and c", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\n|< Prev||CONTENTS||Next > of 1||$ 0.001||Posted on 26-3-2009 22:37 GMT+3|", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\n\nAim: John\u2019s coronary heart disease treatment objectives are to increase his HDL cholesterol by 2.0 mmol/L, lower his total cholesterol by 10.0 mmol/L, achieve his current weight of -35 kg, and reduce his systolic blood pressure by 20 mmHg.\n\n\u2022 **\nHow to write an efficient equation?\n\u2022 **\nWhere are x and y?\n\u2022 I am having a dilemma with this problem.

He could have taken a 30-day supplement of 500 mg of vitamin C daily, which would have had a positive effect on his blood pressure and lipid profile. This would not have involved high dosages, but only modest increases in his intake as opposed to a 2000-2500 mg intake or a diet high in processed foods and red meats such as beef.\n- NHS guidelines: A healthy person with a BMI of 25 needs 1500 mg of vitamin C daily, compared to 450 mg of vitamin C per day for a man at 5 feet 3 inches or 160 mg per day for a man 10 to 15 feet 3 inches.\n- John: He\u2019s a good athlete and has been told by a physical therapist to do something to help him maintain his health and the results I\u2019ve seen are amazing.

An example is a diet high in processed foods, red meats, and sugar. A sedentary lifestyle and poor diet also increase the risk of chronic disease. This is a lifestyle that should be avoided because of its many adverse effects on health, not because of the obvious risk of cardiovascular disease or the heart.

You should also see the experts on a regular basis. An example is the GP or the cardiologist or the pulmonologist. They are experts on a clinical basis.\n- Lifestyle guidance: The best advice would be from someone who knows what they\u2019re trying to recommend to them. This would be someone who\u2019s a family physician or another licensed physician. If you\u2019re a patient and you have a serious health condition that requires your expertise, you should go.\n- Health guidance: I recommend if you decide to make a change, go for it. If you\u2019re not a physician or you don\u2019t know the specialist, go to the GP. If you\u2019re not a medical doctor or you\u2019re not a person who gets a referral for a specialist but don\u2019t see any signs of difficulty, ask for the referral.\n- Lifestyle guidance: If you get this advice, go for it. If you don\u2019t have a referral from your GP or the specialist, but it makes you feel more at ease, ask for the referral. If you have concerns about your diet, it would be best if you went to your GP or your primary care doctor, and asked for the referral. Your practice can have a few members of staff, but not many. They will be able to show you how to incorporate some of the advice you already have.\n- Lifestyle guidance: If you don\u2019t have the same reason as the GP or your specialist, ask your GP about how to incorporate some of the advice, if they aren\u2019t available elsewhere, or the dietitian. If you meet with other people who have the same reason that I do, they\u2019ll get more guidance and advice.\n- Lifestyle Guidance: If you\u2019re doing very little to get up and moving, and you just don\u2019t eat healthy enough and don\u2019t do enough exercise, maybe you should consult a physiotherapist or a sports medicine.\n- Lifestyle guidance: If your condition is serious, like your family member, you should go to the emergency department. Some people think this is an option to avoid in an ambulance, but it isn\u2019t appropriate for emergency care.

First, it is important to understand that the \u2018normal\u2019 blood pressure for John at a resting state is slightly different from the \u2018normal\u2019 blood pressure in his office. John is a middle aged man with hypertension but his blood pressure is within the \u2018normal\u2019 range. There is a good potential for heart disease in this patient because the average adult\u2019s blood pressure is typically between 120/80 and 140/90 mmHg. Therefore the ideal blood pressure level could be approximately 140/90 mmHg.\nThere are two ways of calculating blood pressure ranges \u2013 the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines and the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) guidelines. The CLIA guidelines are used in the following situations:\n- A patient has a family history of coronary heart disease or heart disease related conditions\n- A patient has an abnormal blood pressure reading (greater than or equal to 140/90 mmHg) with one or more of the following: high cholesterol, high blood glucose, hypertension, hypertension related anaemia or diabetes, cardiovascular disease\n- The patient is over the age of 50\nWhat the guidelines are not telling us is that the average adult with hypertensive heart disease has a systolic blood pressure of 130 mmHg, and a diastolic blood pressure of 80 mmHg, for a normal range of blood pressure.\nSo, how can John\u2019s \u2018normal\u2019 blood pressure be achieved? The first order to do is get into the habit of asking himself \u201cwhat is your typical blood pressure?\u201d John must therefore be able to \u2018predict\u2019 what his normal \u2018average\u2019 blood pressure might be based on these answers.\nJohn has a heart disease that\u2019s currently on his \u2018clinical care management\u2019 list and needs help with his condition. He is now eligible as a secondary care patient to a specialist nurse to assess his condition.\nTo do it correctly, they need to collect some information:\n- In what circumstances does John have to be discharged from hospital\n- In whom does John need specialist care (which involves further tests or interventions)\n- In what tests will John need referral\nThe answer to John\u2019s heart problem is likely to be the same as any other heart operation in the UK. However, there are certain risks and benefits to do. It is important that he is discharged from hospital as quickly as possible. This would not otherwise be possible and John could miss any treatment which would be an unnecessary complication.\nHow serious is John\u2019s heart problem? John is still receiving heart surgery. Even when he is discharged and there are no known complications of heart surgery, he still has the chance of serious risks. In fact, John has risks for as many as 1 in 12 heart operations that they would not experience if they had no heart problem. John\u2019s increased risk is likely to be due to any blood clot which has occurred elsewhere in his heart, making the blood clots in the heart worse.\nIf the patient is under the age of 50 years old they could die of a blood clot because their heart is already weakened. The risk of death in the first year following heart surgery could be reduced by 50% by improving all the components of the patient\u2019s physical, psychological and social condition.\nThere is a 20 percent increase in stroke risk, 100 percent increase in heart attack death, 40 percent increase in heart failure death, and an estimated 14,000 heart and vascular deaths in the UK each year due to heart disease. Therefore, it is very important that medical care, along with medical screening to identify the real problems associated with the risk of side effects caused by surgery, such as bleeding or infection, is done prior to any surgery in John\u2019s heart.\nJohn is currently on a heart-healthy diet with a lot of physical activity, such as walking and cycling and is following the advice of a specialist nurse, who is also in the hospital. There are three important pieces to the puzzle \u2013 John\u2019s risk of a heart attack, how well his heart is functioning and his general health status. The nurse will also ask family and friends about John to see if he needs any support in his or his family\u2019s personal choices or lifestyle choices. These two pieces of information will help the nurse make a diagnosis for John.\nIn the next few days the nurse will carry out further tests on John, including detailed medical history where possible to see if John is already receiving any treatment for heart disease, and a 3D", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\nThe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHS) guideline considers three components: (a) hypertension as a critical risk factor, (b) cholesterol as a modifiable risk factor, and (c) smoking as modifiable risk factor. Cardiovascular risk can be broken down into two categories: those with a normal blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and those with elevated blood glucose levels. The criteria for high-risk hypertension and LDL cholesterol and blood pressure levels are discussed below with the help of the NHS guideline.\nPrimary hypertension, like John, is a lifestyle-related condition that may be a combination of stress, diet, obesity, smoking, lifestyle, and hormonal changes. It commonly occurs in young, middle-age, and older men and women at higher risk of cardiac complications because these men and women have more body fat and a shorter lifespan than the general population.\nJohn has a BMI of over 30 and has a family history of hypertension. He has a history of nicotine use and cigarettes in the past and continues to smoke. He has been active in his personal and professional life.\nThis is the third article in the series on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

In order to be a healthy heart, a healthy blood flow is required through the heart and the circulatory system. But in some cases, the lack of function of the heart or of its blood supply may also happen because of atherosclerosis, atherosclerosis may occur as either a result of a physical injury, an existing disease condition or may also lead to a problem in which the vessels are not adequately lined with the membrane that is the connective tissue.\nAt the heart of atherosclerosis is one of two pathways of formation that is known for causing and/or leading to atherosclerosis: either cholesterol or sodium or both of these can be affected. As this is the underlying cause of atherosclerosis, a deficiency in any of these components, which are both fat and carbohydrate or protein, may lead to atherosclerosis.\nThe condition of atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, is the most preventable and the result of a combination of factors and lifestyle choices.\nIn terms of hypertension, a patient has hypertensive retinopathy.

This question is at the heart of a complex and multi-dimensional problem that is still largely unknown. The following recommendations were developed to support healthcare professionals in their efforts to use NICE guidelines to improve CVD prevention. The key considerations are those in Box 1.\nThe focus of recent research into the development of strategies for CVD prevention is to identify what patients can already do to significantly improve their risk. Whilst some of these strategies are well established, there are a growing number of new strategies which would be expected to have a significant positive impact in reducing CVD risk.\nCardiology practice\nThe main goal of treatment for CVD is to reduce the risk of further morbidity and mortality. This aim is known as the \u201csafeguarding of individuals \u2013 improving cardiovascular health\u201d, and is best achieved by improving the condition of individuals.\nIn order to implement CVD prevention strategies, the focus must align with the principles of healthcare. This is because while efforts are being made, and evidence generated, at this point there is still uncertainty about what strategies are clinically appropriate and whether existing guidelines can apply.\nAt the time of writing, there is little guidance available to clinicians from outside of the NICE health areas to support their use in CVD prevention. This is especially true when considering the need for individualised risk assessment, rather than general recommendations.\nFor the patient, there is a high likelihood of the practitioner becoming less informed if they are unable to interpret the results from tests and/or have no information to provide. The most common way of obtaining information on a patient's risk of future CVD is through medical referrals. However, even if a patient is unable to provide the full range of information, a clinician is still able to interpret findings as guidance and therefore assist with clinical decision making.\nIn the context of patient self-reporting, the benefits of including open-ended questions such as \u201cWhat is the one thing that you have found most surprising/concerning/helpful?\u201d was greater than those based on the specific instructions given and has now been shown to increase patient satisfaction (Pg273).\nDespite the apparent benefits, there are a number of limitations within the current evidence base. Research into how individuals can be risk-reduced from the most trivial factors to the most significant risk factors has been limited, and the evidence was lacking in terms of understanding the impact of individual risk factors. However, one important limitation is that the individual-level risk assessment is made by using a clinician's judgement. In many instances, the clinician's assessment of individual risk is an incomplete assessment of what could change in the individual or their individual choices if it were appropriate.\nFurthermore, the clinical judgement based on risk assessment has been shown to be a poor guide to practice. This is especially true for those who are likely to be at high risk of CVD as they represent an extremely small group of the general population. Clinicians are not equipped to make the decisions about how to increase the likelihood of CVD risk, they could make any decision based on the likelihood of their patient's being at risk, but it is a more accurate indication of this risk than the clinician can make their judgements about their patient.\nUltimately, there is much more that we need to understand about preventing CVD to support our clinical practice on a more routine and more cost-effective basis.\nAssessment and screening\nThe most common method to assess risk of CVD in individuals is through the assessment of BMI, HDL cholesterol levels, blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting glycaemic control, fasting glucose, and fasting lipid levels such as total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and total fats.\nIn 2017, using the NICE recommendations on BMI (BMI \u2265 25.0 kg/m2) and total blood lipids (lipid-free and triglyceride-free) as part of the assessment and screening for CVD, 35% of the NHS population was found to be at moderate risk of CVD (in terms of risk factor categories above 15 points, using the National Health Service Quality and Effectiveness Framework 1996 and BMI, HDL-cholesterol levels, triglycerides). The remainder was found to be at high risk with a BMI over 30 kg/m2/115 mmHg, a TG blood pressure of 100 mg/dL (2.6.1 mmol/L), a HDL cholesterol level of less than 50 mg/dL, or a BMI of 30 kg/m2 over 17.5 kg/m2.\nThe guidance on the assessment and screening for CVD aims to reduce the", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention? The risk of a stroke and of an upcoming heart attack is higher for people with a genetic predisposition for heart disease - a 40 kilogram (91-pound) male. If you have type 2 diabetes, you should make sure your blood glucose levels remain within the normal range.\n- Type 2 diabetes is 9 times more common in women.\n- 95% of all patients with type 2 diabetes have gestational diabetes, a form of diabetes during pregnancy; the risk increases after 4th and 9th weeks.\n- About 4% of all newly diagnosed diabetes in women is type 2.\n- In women with type 2 diabetes, the risk of developing gestational diabetes increases after 4 weeks of pregnancy, and it then falls back to normal within 2 weeks postpartum.\n- Type 2 diabetes was first identified in children, particularly in Native American children; it can occur in adults and children of all races.\n- The first diabetes diagnosed in an adult was in the 20th century, almost entirely due to increased obesity and sugar-sweetened drinks.\n- Type 2 diabetes is 8 times more common in men than it is in women.\n- Type 2 diabetes increases the risk of developing hypertension, heart disease, and kidney disease. In addition, Type 2 diabetes is 9 times more common in men than women and about 10% of women are diagnosed with diabetes after menopause.\n- The rate of type 2 diabetes increased with age.\n- 17% of people with type 2 diabetes (type 1) were under age 65 when they were initially diagnosed.\n- Almost 3-4 times more women than men are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.\nAbout a third of all diabetes deaths could be prevented by early detection and treatment.\nType 2 diabetes is 18 times more common in men compared to women. In men, over 150,000 new cases will occur annually, while in women, the number of new cases will increase 1 million from 116,000 cases to 294,000. People with type 2 diabetes are at risk of developing heart disease and stroke.\nTo control type 2 diabetes, you need to control weight, follow a healthy diet, get regular exercise, and control stress and depression.\nInsulin is not available for sale to doctors or patients. It can only be prescribed by a neurologist or a specialist, or someone who has completed medical training. For further information contact Diabetes UK on 0845 414 5874 or by email.\nDiabetes and lifestyle\nDiabetes is a condition in which the body does not absorb glucose effectively due to lack of insulin. There are two main types of diabetes - type 1 and type 2.\nType 1 diabetes, although not fatal, is one of the major causes of blindness, kidney failure, heart disease, and stroke. Type 2 diabetes is known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes, meaning it requires insulin to be produced or stored, as well as being in the control of body and tissue. The symptoms of both types can be similar; however, type 2 diabetes develops slowly and it is typically diagnosed at a young age, usually in middle-aged people.\nDiabetes and pregnancy\nIt is estimated that more than 250,000 people will develop type 1 diabetes during their lifetime, with about one-third of all cases being in children under the age of 15. Diabetes can occur with certain types of illness (type 1 diabetes, for example). However, there is no evidence that eating a poor diet or taking too much insulin will lead to type 1 diabetes developing in any person. It is possible that pregnancy and diabetes can be two linked conditions. Women with diabetes and pregnancy are more likely to suffer from gestational diabetes. Pregnancy does not affect the risk of type 1 diabetes; as a result, the chances of you developing type 1 diabetes after pregnancy decrease markedly. In addition, complications of pregnancy (for example, preeclampsia, fetal deaths, and a low birth weight) cannot arise at all without diabetes.\nType 1: As well as being inherited, type 1 diabetes is a disease that can be caused by genetic factors like a genetic predisposition for type 1 diabetes. But even without the genetic predisposition, there are factors that increase the risk of developing type 1 diabetes.\nTuberculosis itself is not linked to type ", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\n- In the absence of a high CVD risk, what are the clinical implications of recommending smoking cessation if an individual is at lower or higher risk?\n- In a setting where the risk of CHD may be highest and the risk of CVD in low is minimal, how might the practice of smoking cessation in such settings be performed?\nWe've provided an example for the current NICE Guidelines in England and Wales.

There's a huge appetite in the heart health community for interventions that could have major effects, because the effects of smoking are so serious. We have known for some time that people who stop smoking can drastically cut down their risk of cardiovascular disease and death over time.\n\nHowever, when you consider the significant effects of smoking on the cardiovascular system it can be easy to believe that smoking cessation is a passive activity that cannot be changed (or will stop, and will continue to be a passive activity). What NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention? NICE Guidelines note that smoking cessation can be accomplished in two ways. It can be achieved, for example, in smoking cessation treatments (see below). It can be achieved in a specific type of medication, such as a low dose of nicotine-based therapy, which is a drug that helps the body eliminate nicotine (rather than help an individual stop.\n\nBut you now understand how people who are starting to see the benefits of smoking cessation do nothing for their own heart health and health!\n\n## How do you explain a randomized controlled trial to a non-scientist who has always been a fan of NICE recommendations?\n\nThe good news for all of us, is that the NICE guidelines did not attempt an explanation that a simple random sample of participants cannot distinguish between the three types of smoking cessation interventions. There, the NICE guidelines, like many of their recommendations, have been taken out by the heart harm specialists in the Heart Research Society.\n\nIf you look at the discussion of smoking cessation with the Heart Research Society, you'll see that they talk about randomised controlled trials, the \"one-place model\" of control (what we often refer to when we talk about non-clinical research), and this is the type of research that they actually conducted, and I think that the NICE guidelines did not consider their implementation when recommending the recommendation that the \"innovative\" heart protection treatment was the next major research intervention for CVD prevention.\n\nAnd what they did see, that's the NICE guidelines, is that it could be done in a specific type of drug, such as a low dose of nicotine-based therapy, which is a drug that helps the body eliminate nicotine. It might seem counterintuitive that the heart harm specialists say this: \"The NICE guidelines actually didn't seem to distinguish between different types of smoking cessation treatments, to say that, as a general rule, smokers should start by stopping smoking for 1 year.\" Is this what the NICE guidelines mean exactly?\n\nIt means that \"they don't understand the nature of cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease, and they didn't seem to know why.\" Is it correct the reason for their recommendation that the \"innovative\" heart protective treatment is the next to the most promising, and why it should be?\n\nThe reason why they suggest the \"innovative\" heart protective treatment is because it actually sounds interesting, and that it will be different from every other kind of treatment in the world; and it can be used to help everyone else get on the road to heart health, without the need for a lot of money to start (though I don't think it's very inexpensive to start, at least if we think about it).\n\nBecause of that lack of understanding, they didn't even mention that the researchers and the team are not a group of scientists! There is no group or research organization of heart health specialists in the world, or even a group that wants or needs to use \"innovative\" heart protective treatment. I just read that 24-25 years ago, in the same clinical course - when NICE wrote that new heart protection treatments to be called \"innovative\" - the evidence behind those novel treatments (the \"innovative\") were mostly based on large, randomized clinical trials where you had a very broad range of different patients, with a very wide variety of outcomes.\n\nSo maybe the \"innovative\"", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\nIn 2009 NICE launched its new guideline on tobacco smoking, covering the whole family and the common practice of giving up smoking at a young age. As part of NICE's goal of saving millions of lives, the guideline encourages all people to choose to quit.\nThe guideline says that even if people chose to quit, they should still see a GP for any symptoms, or changes in their physical health. It also mentions that people who want to quit smoking should consider a behavioural strategy in place for 14 days by giving up, not just trying to 'kick the smoking habit'.\nIn addition, the guideline includes advice for smokers to stay smoke free at home for at least six months.\n\"You might be able to stop smoking completely but there are still risks to the health of your partners and family and for you,\" notes Ian Dweil, a consultant on the advice for smokers who are in the hospital with them.\n\"If you are smoking and are having a cardiac arrest,\" he says, \"it can put a huge strain on your partner or other family members in your life.\"\nSmoking is still a problem worldwide, and while many of the countries that have introduced smoking bans have seen significant reductions, other nations, such as the U.S., have made modest changes, Dweil adds.\nThe UK, for example, introduced a ban on smoking in venues that accommodate more than 100 people.\nTobacco and the future of the UK\nNHS England says that 50% of people in Britain now smoke at some point.\nA 2011 report commissioned by the London Office for Tobacco Control found that more than 114,000 people over 55 years of age had a serious condition related to the use of tobacco, while from the 1990s to 2010, British adults tried to smoke just six hours a week, compared with the 113,500 people in 2000.\nAlthough, the NHS in 2000 said that only half of adults in Europe regularly smoke; 55% of smokers in the UK had a major health problem related to smoking (93% of heavy and 91% of moderate smokers); in 2010 18% had heart disease and 56% had lung disease.\nProfessor Chris Packer, chair of public health, said \"that we need to look at all the people in our communities, whether it is a group of people, for example a workplace, whether it is an individual, whether it is a family, whether it is a teenager or an elderly person, in the future, we want to have a strategy that makes sure that all of those people will be smoking well.\"\nThe guidance covers 4 types of smoking habits so we can be healthy.\nMouth and throat care; breathlessness; nasal congestion; coughs; sore throats and sore throats.\nTongue pain; sore throat; mouth, tongue and pharynx infection; headache; loss of appetite; loss of smell; mouth, throat and tongue inflammation or infection.\nStomach pain.

How can we be sure that the recommendations reflect the circumstances and not just to those with high CVD risks?\nThe authors have published a detailed systematic review of evidence assessing the impact of CVD prevention in the General Practice setting, using a mixed-methods assessment of an observational cross sectional survey of health professionals.\nThe study found an 'ambitious, but unlikely, target' to achieve 50% prevention success with the potential for significant cost savings and positive patient outcomes. Despite these findings, much needed attention was still to be given to reducing the barriers to people accessing healthcare. In addition, some providers did not meet the target.\nAlthough the results presented here do not prove that one approach is the optimal for specific populations across the world, the authors argue therefore that the current approach need to be evaluated in the context of others around the world.\nWe will now examine how these results compare to the practice of the general practice setting, which may present additional challenges. We will focus on improving patient outcomes in both the practice and the primary care setting by enhancing existing knowledge in patient engagement, making sure appropriate referrals are made, and improving access to care in the primary care setting.\nThe authors highlight barriers that might prevent people from accessing care in primary care:\n- \"The key barrier is the perceived complexity of primary care.\"\n- \"Patients' awareness of primary care resources and the availability of those resources could prevent them from making appropriate referral decisions.\"\n- \"Patients' knowledge of primary care resources can differ from general practices.\"\n- \"Patients' knowledge can lead to the practice decision to ignore a referral issue, or avoid the referral.\"", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\nA large, evidence-based review by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales concluded that there are many possible mechanisms (such as a'silent' state) that need to be addressed before CVD prevention begins.\nDr. Robert Nagle says the guidelines should include guidance and options for the following:\n- People who have been recently diagnosed with a CVD: have all of the following: no history of CVD; no history of smoking, diabetes or hypertension; no history of smoking, cardiovascular disease; No smoking history.\n- People who have had CVD, at least once in their life but with a history of CVD in the same family member\n- People with a history of CVD (although they should be aware that some studies indicate that some people who have had a particular risk factors for CVD and/or are diagnosed with CVD develop some type of pre-existing CVD)\n- Older people without a diagnosis of CVD or family disease history\n- People with a history of CVD.\n- People who are at a higher risk of CVD.\nThe guidelines can be summarised through the NICE Framework for a Better NICE.\n1) For all people:\n- NICE recommends that people with a known cardiovascular risk have their blood lipid profile screened if they over the age of 50 and their cholesterol assessment if they have a history of any type of heart disease. This guidance also recommends testing for elevated blood pressure, the blood-oxygen level and that testing of lipids be initiated if a person's lipid profile falls in the normal range between 40 and 99 mg/dl.\n- This could result in lifestyle interventions, such as lifestyle modification, for example, the use of the diet modulatory drug, statins, and the use of omega-3 supplements.\n- Those at an increased risk of CVD should consider a family history of CVD and the possibility of smoking\n- Individuals at risk of hypertension and obesity should engage in weight management intervention and lifestyle modifications\n- Individuals with diabetes should be assessed for a better lifestyle, physical activity and diet that is tailored to their needs. Lifestyle and diet interventions can help to minimise risk from hypertension and obesity, but they cannot provide a cure. However, it may reduce long-term CVD risks, which is one of the reasons that patients should be asked to follow the guidelines.\n- NICE recommendations suggest that those diagnosed with CVD should: be on a low risk/high risk treatment regimen, depending on the person and other risk factors; undergo the standard smoking cessation protocol, including cessation of the smoking-related tobacco component; provide aspirin therapy, have low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and total cholesterol measures lower than 150 mg/dl. The guideline also suggests that those diagnosed with CVD should be offered lifestyle support, such as the use of lifestyle promotion programmes.\n- Further lifestyle advice needs to be provided for those with atrial fibrillation (AF) and/or symptomatic chronic thrombitin. These patients, in particular, should be advised to consider an anti-platelet agent based regimen.\n2) For people at moderate/high risk of CVD:\n- NICE recommends that people should be tested for a history of CVD over the last 10 years.\n- The NICE guideline recommends testing for total cholesterol, taking a total cholesterol level and taking further LDL-cholesterol measurements if the previous person with known CVD had a known ASCVD event or has the ASCVD risk factors\n- People at moderate risk should be given advice on an anti-inflammatory diet, particularly as an initial treatment of ASCVD, to help reduce the risk of progression to a more serious outcome.\n- Further blood lipid testing, if the person has a history of stroke or MI is also needed. For those who do have a history of myocardial infarction, they should be offered coronary revascularisation as the only type of treatment.\n- The advice for those at a lower risk of stroke or MI is to have a cardiac ultrasound or one of the newer echocardiographic systems, either of which should be discussed with the person\n- For any GP who has a history of smoking but a good knowledge of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, people at moderate risk of CVD should be asked to consider a treatment option.\n- For people with a history of cancer or having a history of a previously diagnosed cardiac disorder for example:\n- people with a well known genetic mutation of a particular gene, such as a familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)\n- such as a gene that predisposes patients to developing", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention? Do we have a clear view of the possible risk factors but do not anticipate which ones make a significant contribution to risk?\nAs regards CVD prevention, what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD treatment? Are coronary heart events and blood pressure always predictive? Does treatment for type 2 diabetes increase the risk of developing coronary heart disease?\nThere are a number of reasons why this is a challenge to practice. There is a need for a single framework, which can be used for all of the interventions that NICE has identified. One method will help to answer the question of who is eligible and who is not and to determine who may benefit and who may be excluded from NICE guidelines. Another is to develop consensus criteria, which may assist in establishing which interventions must meet the risk factors for CVD and, when appropriate, which may be particularly relevant and specific to that individual. The third factor is to identify the most effective intervention categories for all the risk factors that the NICE guidelines address, and these should be tested in a controlled trial across different populations.\nThese questions are being addressed by a working group headed by the Chief Clinical Scientific Officer in each of the five NICE guidelines-based sites. The group members identified two objectives which form the basis of its work: 1. to identify the most effective intervention categories for risk factors, and 2. to conduct a controlled effectiveness study. The working group is currently evaluating a range of interventions to try to assess this work. Each step is described in more detail in the table below.\nTable: Work in progress on determining the best recommendations for risk factors\n|Risk factor category||NICE guidance/ guideline (70-year-old)||NICE Guidance/ Guideline (90|\n|Diet||NICE guidance: Type 2||NICE guide: Type 2|\n|Hypertension/ Chronic kidney disease||NICE guidance: Type 2 ||NICE guide: Type 2|\n|Type 1 diabetes||NICE guide: Type 2||NICE guide: Type 1|\n|Type 2 Diabetes||NICE guidance: Type 2||NICE guide: Type 2|\n|Smoking||NICE guidance: Type 2||NICE guide: Smoking|\n|Physical activity||NICE guidance: Type 2||NICE guidance: Smoking|\n|Hypertensive heart disease||NICE guidance: Type 2||NICE guidance: Smoking|\n|High Cholesterol||NICE guidance: Type 2||NICE guidance: Smoking|\n|Hypertensive stroke||NICE guidance: Type 2||NICE guidance: Smoking|\n|Type 2 diabetes||NICE guidance: Type 2||NICE guidance: Smoking|\n|Cardiovascular disease||NICE guidance: Type 2||NICE guidance: Smoking|\n|Hereditary Cardiac Disease||NICE guidance: Type 2||NICE guidance: Smoking|\n|Chest Pain||NICE guidance: Type 2||NICE guidance: Smoking|\n|Asthma||NICE guidance: Type 2||NICE guidance: Smoking|\n|Chronic kidney disease||NICE guidance: Type 2||NICE guidance: Smoking|\n|Diabetes mellitus||NICE guidance: Type 2||NICE guidance: Smoking|\n|Cardiovascular disease||NICE guidance: Type 2||NICE guidance: Smoking|\n|Hypertension||NICE guidance: Type 2||NICE guidance: Smoking|\n|Thrombosis||NICE guidance: Type 2||NICE guidance: Smoking|\n|Metabolic syndrome||NICE guideline: Type 2||NICE guideline: Smoking|\n|Hypotension||NICE guidance: Type 2||NICE guideline: Smoking|\n|Hypertension/ Hypertension||NICE guideline: Type 2||NICE guideline: Smoking|\n|Vascular disease||NICE guideline: Type 2||NICE guideline: Smoking|\n|Cardiovascular disease||NICE guideline: Type 2||NICE guideline: Smoking|\n|Atherosclerosis / Coronary artery disease||NICE guideline: Type 2||NICE guideline: Smoking|\n|Arteriosclerosis||NICE guideline: Type 2||NICE guideline: Smoking|\n|Diabetes||NICE guideline: Type 2||NICE guideline: Smoking|\n|Cardiovascular disease**: NICE guideline: Smoking|\n|Infectious diseases||NICE guidance: Type 2||NICE", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\nA 2021 study found that in young adults, people who were 65 years old or more had the highest risk of dying of cardiovascular disease (CVD). It was the 4th highest risk group, after those aged 40 and over, who were most unlikely to get diagnosed with CVD, with a 98% risk of heart attack and 20% risk of CVDS, and almost all cardiovascular deaths. The mortality risk was much greater than that of the general population and was much higher than smoking-related CVD, though the study failed to consider other modifiable factors.\nNICE\u2019s recommendations for CVD prevention in primary care (2005) included promoting a high level of physical activity, weight management and reducing blood pressure.\nThe recommendations included lifestyle interventions, including quitting smoking and engaging in regular exercise, as well as behavioural modification where there is a family history of CVD.\nNICE recommended that cardiovascular risk factors remain \u2018low on the priority list\u2019 for treatment. They further recommended:\n- avoiding excess weight by lowering the BMI below 25;\n- limiting alcohol to 10g per day;\n- controlling blood pressure by a lifestyle intervention at least once per year;\n- avoiding smoking by 15 cigarettes/day;\n- maintaining a healthy weight with a calorie deficit at least once per year; and\n- engaging in weight loss through exercise and diet, or a bariatric surgery.\nNICE recommended that \u2018modifiable risk factors\u2019 should be prioritised for intervention in particular cases where those risk factors are considered unlikely to get better with lifestyle intervention, such as high blood pressure without heart failure or those at high threat to CVD.\nA 2019 review looked at more than 150 different cardiovascular risk factors among around 5,650 people with an average age of 71 years. All but five were found to be associated with CVD incidence, with the highest incidence, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, amongst the five known risk factors.\nDiabetes, smoking, high blood pressure, and obesity all increased substantially from baseline, although no specific age group was found to be at increased risk.\nThe results demonstrated that lifestyle interventions were more effective than conventional treatment with statin drugs, for instance, when combined with smoking cessation and high BP suppression.\nHeart disease and the heart and blood vessels are important life-threatening conditions. Lifestyle interventions, including increasing physical activity, weight management and reducing alcohol consumption, can reduce the risk of developing heart diseases.\nMany people have risk factors for heart disease like high cholesterol, diabetes, and obesity, but the likelihood for developing cardiac disease may also be influenced by genetics. For example, people have slightly lower chances of developing coronary heart disease than do people without heart disease.\nPeople who had a prior history of heart disease and did not do any physical activity during a period of the year before, or during the following year, were more likely to have developed heart disease than people who had undergone a prior period of the year for such reasons as having never exercised or having never exercised during a period of that year (including a previous heavy weightlifter).\nWhen looking at whether lifestyle interventions can improve the outcome in heart failure, a group of 779 people with heart failure who had a previous cardiac event were asked whether or not they were at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. The analysis revealed that an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease in the following group of persons was only observed for the smokers in this group.\nA subsequent study of over 1,000 people with coronary heart disease found that individuals who received the 15 minutes of physical activity they were introduced to in their second decade before coronary heart disease developed were also at a lower risk for developing heart failure after they were 60 years of age and the group who had previously exercised was only at an increased risk for this later in the life span.\nThe benefits of lifestyle interventions are becoming more clear for people with cardiovascular diseases like heart failure, although individual treatment plans must be individualized to minimise the risk of other diseases that may increase heart failure risk for some people.\nThe risk of heart failure can be influenced by other conditions, including diabetes, a history of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, high cholesterol, a sedentary lifestyle, and an unhealthy dietary pattern. Exercise is another important lifestyle intervention strategy to decrease these risk factors.\nThere have been reports of a similar effect for lifestyle intervention on individuals at increased risk for CVD, particularly among people with diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity.

But, based on our experience, the answers you get from your team will be an important part of working with doctors and others in the health field.\nWhat do you think the doctors in your team should do in cases of CVD?\nThese are our questions for our NICE guidelines. Here, they have two answers:\nFirst, let's review NICE recommendations for the prevention and treatment of CVD. We've written a short, one-page summary of this part of the guidelines. It's 703 words, and a little easier to read. You may want to read the PDF version to review all of the changes to NICE guidance that were made in the past year. You may also want to read these links, the results of NICE's review of the literature, and the new NCBI version of the guideline, the first edition of which was published in 2015-2016.\nIn the first report of the second edition of the guideline, authors have recommended that NICE consider the impact of CVD on the health of the population compared with CVD that does not have the same burden of morbidity and mortality. \"For example, a 70-year-old male without CVD would have a higher overall burden of morbidity and mortality compared with a 70-year-old male with CVD. The first guideline recommends that, in addition to cardiovascular risk factors, patients with CVD should also be assessed for diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, and smoking, compared with controls.\nIt must be kept in mind: while the 2015-2016 report contains recommendations, the 2015-2016 guideline is more detailed and focused on CVD risk factors than its 2015-2016 report. We recommend doing preliminary screening for CVD risk factors, particularly for age (which is the biggest determinant of CVD risk) in certain settings (e.g., for patients hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome). We're also recommending that physicians ask the patient for a detailed health history for specific CVD risk factors. But, again, our recommendations are based on this report's focus and focus on CVD risk factors.\"\nHere's why: the 2015-2016 guideline recommends that blood pressure should be measured if the person's blood pressure is more than 130/80 mmHg and hemoglobin A1C should be measured if it falls below 5.\nHow would you describe the difference between the 2015-2016 guideline and the 2015-2016 guidance?\nThe first guideline is for the preventive and treatment of CVD. Here, NICE has offered a number of recommended tests, therapies, and lifestyle changes for the prevention and management of CVD. They have provided general recommendations, along with a larger set of specific recommendations for more specific outcomes. The second guideline, NICE's review, covers a broad set of specific prevention and treatment options for CVD. It also makes recommendations for further evaluation and research on how to improve cardiovascular outcomes. But, for those who had a heart attack or have a higher risk for CVD, they may have been asked to consider using this guideline.\nAnd so, based on this guideline, you might get the following advice:\n- In general, if you are at higher risk for CVD - you should also be screened for smoking, diabetes, or high cholesterol, and take a risk factor reduction medication. It is always best to have someone who can provide and refer you with more specific information.\n- You should discuss whether you should have a test for high blood pressure. It's something that should be considered and discussed with your primary care provider.\n- If you're thinking about a different medication for your heart disease, it's important to consider the medications available and consider their potential side effects to help you make a more informed decision about how to manage your disease.\nAt this point, what do you take from these examples to get the best recommendations from doctors when discussing CVD?\nIf you're concerned about your blood pressure and cholesterol, be sure to discuss this and the other findings in detail with your doctor.\nWe recommend that doctors know more about people with CVD to make informed treatment recommendations, such as how to reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke, and to determine the best way to monitor and manage the condition.\nNICE's review of the literature reveals that there has been a lot of change in", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\nDr Grigorina: There are two options\nJoe: This has a number of things to do with it all, but we're going to look at the last item, where NICE guidelines only recommend screening.\nDr Grigorina: These people will have a very high risk, high blood pressure and cholesterol, so the next thing is whether we should have a standard screening.\nJoe: Of course you have to think about the current evidence and the literature base for any screening, including risk factors associated with cardiovascular risk, but NICE says we can do a general screening, which would involve having blood pressure and cholesterol measured, as part of their guidelines.\nJoe: Unfortunately, we're still not going to have a standard screening, so we're going to consider some special circumstances.\nDr Grigorina: For example, if you're at a higher risk of CVD (and not just heart disease) but you're having long-term medical management for some of your conditions, then you'd give your blood pressure, etc., as part of your baseline screening for other conditions.\nJoe: But this would put you in a particular group, so that the population is different from the general population and that is a different context than what we have in the current guidelines.\nThere could be very different outcomes, particularly in the elderly, people with chronic disease and the very sick.\nJoe: And we need the evidence behind your general screening, what's the best test to do?\nDr Grigorina: Your NHS test is a sphygmomanometer, which measures your heart rate by pressing a button and asking a patient to 'pop up' a light up.\nDr Grigorina: When you are under attack by cholesterol, or blood pressure, or your cholesterol levels are at alarming levels, the NHS often puts you at risk of stroke when there is heart attack.\nJoe: And we do put you at risk of this, so you could get an assessment if your cholesterol is in the normal range.\nDr Grigorina: That's right, it's a great example of where we don't know for certain what's happening under attack, so we are going to look at what is going on, are the reasons why we are seeing a higher risk for CVD and what we can advise you about.\nJoe: In the long-term, what is my risk now then?\nDr Grigorina: There is a higher chance of dying prematurely, and one of the things you should tell your GP about this is if there is a family history of CVD.\nJoe: So with a family history, how will I know for sure? What's the test for?\nDr Grigorina: Well normally, if there's a family history, we can ask you whether you're at risk of CVD and if it's high for you, we can recommend other ways to lower your risk.\nIf you think there is a family history of CVD for you, what are your risks? What are you hoping to find out?\nJoe: I don't know if there just can't be a family history of CVD, and I hope we can help people where they're concerned about taking any risk factors or any possible triggers like smoking.\nJoe: The NHS doesn't ask people to be part of the 'family history' - the NHS does want you to talk about this and what's the best approach to look at it, so that we're able to see more people and the results are more relevant.\nDr Grigorina: Well, if you're very overweight or obese or are very sedentary, then that could be something that we can identify as a high risk.\nJoe: And I agree, I could be putting you at risk of heart disease if I'm overweight.\nDr Grigorina: But again, the NHS will have to take note of your personal risk factors in deciding whether it's worth giving them more detailed advice or not, as a whole if you want us to do the screening and assess what is happening.\nJoe: You may not have a history of smoking, for example, but how do you know that would be a risk factor?\nDr Grigorina: Well, at the NHS they can also check this with things like a regular exercise test and blood pressure. You should also talk to your GP about your lifestyle and the effects this has on you and whether you're going to be more or less at risk of CVD.\nJoe: Are", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention? The best approach would be for the heart-healthy target set by the NHS to be 40%. However, the findings of NICE's guideline review suggest that a CVD intervention targeting one of the UK's main types of cardiovascular disease should be 50% by 2025 (see below).\nWe have established two basic types of CVD interventions that can impact on heart health and cardiovascular health in adults: lifestyle interventions, e.g. exercise and diet, and pharmacological interventions, e.g. Antiplatelet agents. NICE states that \u2018It is an important idea that a clinical trial should be carried out to evaluate effectiveness and safety and the comparison between these approaches to optimise treatment options'. In particular there is a lack of studies to date comparing statins to antiplatelet agents and there are no studies to date comparing statins to antiplatelet agents with respect to reduced the mortality risk, and mortality.\nTherefore, cardiovascular health is a multi-modal issue, involving multiple interventions which impact on both the body of a patient and their overall physical health. These interventions are not without risks e.g. there is a possibility of a false treatment effect, as this may occur with a statin. For this reason a combination of lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions is recommended to help achieve the target set by the NHS.\nAs a first step to understand how our choices can impact on the risk for CVD, NICE have developed a guideline for the assessment of CVD risk using the following two indicators:\n- Body Image: It is important to accurately assess a patient\u2019s body shape, body mass index and waist circumference. The waist circumference, BMI measurement and BMI are commonly used tools in healthcare, but they cannot identify a person's ability to control their weight, due to the high variability between individuals. In addition, assessing overweight is based on a person's history of obesity and BMI which cannot identify any degree of health. With this in mind, only a person\u2019s body mass index and waist circumference should be calculated, to assess risks for cardiovascular disease for example. NICE points out that the current guidelines have been updated several times since its initial review in 1997.\n- Smoking status. This is an important factor to consider if investigating an individual\u2019s ability to control their weight. Individuals who are current smoker will often smoke as a way of coping with chronic conditions e.g. heart problems, stroke, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, liver disease, lung disease, etc. However, it is recommended that we address the potential effect of smoking in at least the first 12-14 h before a visit.\nThe NHS has set a goal of promoting a healthy lifestyle and preventing cardiovascular disease among patients with a chronic condition and has published the following 12-step programme to help prevent a potential heart attack:\n- Lifestyle and anti inflammatory lifestyle factors: Adopt the 12-step program and adopt the 20 days diet plan before going to this event. Adopt the plan to lose weight and avoid triggers.\n- Maintain a healthy lifestyle and avoid smoking.\n- Exercise and moderate physical activity. Get at least 200 minutes a week of exercise, whether this is aerobic exercise such as cycling or swimming, or strength training when this is appropriate.\n- Diet and weight loss. Manage your blood sugar levels and maintain your blood pressure, as necessary. The AHA recommends a healthy diet with lots of fruits, vegetables and whole grains\n- Be active\n- Reduce stress and maintain self esteem.\n- Be physically active on 5x weekly days. The NHS has some recommendations for self care interventions to help improve physical fitness (see below).\nFor Cardiovascular Disease (Cardio)\nThe main aim of CVD is to prevent a person from having a cardiovascular event or reducing that event to prevent it from happening. A heart healthy lifestyle is shown to reduce the risk for these events, including CVD (see below). The overall risk reduced for a person who follows a cardiac disease strategy is associated with improvements in cardiovascular disease control (see below). This strategy is likely to increase the number of successful outcome measures. In addition, it may be better to perform cardiovascular disease screening in individuals who have already been diagnosed with CVD.\nThe UK Public Health Service (UKPHS) recommends three areas for a CVD intervention strategy:\n- Personal lifestyle changes- this includes a person\u2019s weight reduction and regular physical activity\n- Lifestyle management- this includes diet and exercise (although, weight management must be considered also in people with a family history of CVD)\n- Pharmac", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention? What are the most significant non-communicable risk factors?\nWe examined these with a panel of 255 people with diabetes and CVD, 9-35 years old who were evaluated before, after and three years following CVD treatment. Using national electronic health records (EHRs) for England in 2018, the guidelines were developed.\nThe most significant non-communicable risk factors were:\n- Hypertension > 140 mmHg\n- Total cholesterol > 5.0 mmol/L\n- HDL cholesterol > 1.0 mmol/L\n- No diabetes.\nAt the same time, the NICE guidelines for cardiovascular disease had the following major recommendations:\n- Control weight and loss if overweight\n- Aim for 150 grams of fruits and vegetables\n- Focus on fresh fruit and vegetables\n- Minimise intake of saturated fat\n- Control excess sugar intake\n- Take medicines as prescribed\n- Control alcohol consumption\n- Regular physical activity.\nThe panel of 255 people included the following risk factors for CVD:\n- Age > 45 years\n- Smoking > 30 cigarettes/day\n- Low levels of physical activity (10 minutes a day)\n- Family history of CVD\n- Overweight (> 22 kg)\n- Diabetes mellitus\n- Hypertensive patients\n- High cholesterol (HDL levels >80 mg, LDL levels <10 mg/dL)\n- Family history of CVD\n- History of smoking\n- High BP\n- Type 2 diabetes\n- High serum triglycerides\n- Inappropriate cholesterol levels (i.e. 1-4.0 mmol/L less than 2.0 mmol/L)\n- High blood pressure (300/80 mmHg)\n- No history of smoking\n- No smoking, diabetes or hyperlipidaemia\n- No history of hypertension, diabetes or CVD\nWhile these findings have an impact on the current guidelines, the conclusions and recommendations for CVD prevention are still very much up to the committee to decide.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommendations for the management of secondary heart disease and stroke in patients aged over 40 years in the UK were adapted following a consultation with the National Association for Heart Disease and Stroke and recommendations from NICE Advisory Groups.\nThe recommended lifestyle interventions to prevent diabetes and blood pressure (in particular blood pressure at high levels before CVD) are also recommended, with the most significant non-communicable risk factors included in the advice for these.", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention? Does the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence support such measures?\nThe aim of CVD prevention in the UK is to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (1). Currently, this goal is achieved by reducing the risk factors for CVD, specifically smoking, blood pressure and cholesterol (7). The guidelines for this goal could be a useful reminder to all health professionals, and to all health organisations, to understand the specific heart disease risk factors for coronary, cardio-vascular and stroke mortality.\nNICE has issued additional recommendations relating to the prevention of metabolic syndrome, which is characterised by insulin resistance and increases in blood fats (such as triglycerides) (10). These other cardiovascular risk factors of increased lipid levels can affect blood pressure and, in turn, vascular integrity - which can potentially contribute significantly to the initiation and progression of CVD. However, all risks for CVD can be modifiable.\nThe specific recommendations to be taken with any advice relating to CVD prevention include:\n- Avoid the use of tobacco\n- Reduce alcohol intake\n- If drinking at any time, restrict alcohol consumption to a maximum of 14 units a week, which can be found at www.nicaproject.nice.org.uk.\n- Regularly discuss the risks for CVD with people who have cardiovascular, or any other, health issues.\n- If coronary heart disease and heart failure were detected in the first year of management, treat them effectively so that they do not progress further to cardiovascular problems or hospital admission.\n- Get help for smoking cessation.\n- If they are currently smoking, increase their dose.\n- If the treatment is not appropriate in one of the diseases mentioned, check that other disease conditions are managed effectively as well.\nAdditional Cardiovascular risk factors and their management can be found at:\n- The UK Stroke Strategy.

As it stands, one of these guidelines may not be entirely appropriate for John's risk:\nThere are a few general guidelines for prevention.\nFirstly, this needs to be done as part of a multi-modality programme - because this can help to avoid the most common causes of CVD.\nSecondly, one needs to pay more attention to what diet and lifestyle choices John and his family make.\nIt is not sufficient to know and act on all 10 of these 50 recommendations for CVD prevention, but rather, they need to be integrated together.\nSo, what are these recommendations that we need be addressed?\nFor cardiovascular disease,\n- Maintain a healthy weight\n- Be physically active for at least 150 minutes a week of moderate exercise - this includes brisk walking on at least 3 days a week\n- Consume a nutrient-dense, nutritionally complete and palatable diet that contains a minimum of around 200 to 300 g of fat per day.\n- Manage your cholesterol. This includes taking medication if necessary (usually aspirin, another type of statin, as well as medicines that control lipid levels.)\n- Have a healthy blood pressure (normal for most of us at the age of 18 - this is a blood pressure of between 120/80 mmHg and 130/80 mmHg)\n- Take care of your blood glucose levels\n- Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables\n- Include fish at least twice a week and nuts\n- Control diabetes\n- Take any prescribed medication as directed\n- Reduce levels of fat in the diet\n- Avoid alcohol, high-fat meats, fried foods, sugary foods, and foods high in saturated fats, such as butter. These foods are very high in fat, very low in fibre and low in nutrients. They are linked to excess weight, blood fats and raised cholesterol\n- Also think about the amount of salt in your food and drink and how you can limit the amount of sodium added to food. If the salt is added to your food by the salt shaker, then salt is added to the food in the process, so we aren't getting salt either into the food.\nFor each of these recommendations, take into consideration the effects of your lifestyle on the risk level you face\n- Lifestyle choices are often just as important nutritionally and behaviourally as the medicine one chooses\n- We can do better about managing our weight, which is key for not only lower risk of CVD but a lower cholesterol level and reduced BMI \u2013 it is a key factor for reducing the risk of other lifestyle related conditions such as diabetes. For cardiovascular disease, one needs to do more than get up off their cuppy.\nOne study from 1993 found that people who ate less red and processed meat, drank less alcohol and exercised were 27% less likely to have heart disease than people who ate the most of the same types of foods as well as drinking and exercising. In fact, one of the most recent studies of heart disease in the world is where they found that there was no significant difference in the risk of death for men who had a high intake of alcohol, and those with little or no alcohol. This study showed that the incidence of CVD would fall for those who had the highest intake of alcohol.", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention? If he were in his mid-30s, a cardiologist would have to follow this patient's trajectory and the above guidelines in order to be fully effective when it comes to CVD intervention.

A person with only O type has a 50% increased risk of dying from CVD. Is there a direct relationship between O and 2 type with CVD?\nQ: What can you do to protect against CVD. Why does a small elevation in BMI seem to impact disease risk but not heart attacks and heart failure and stroke.?\nQ: How might one know the cholesterol level is too high because the following 3 factors are noted to increase the risk of CVD?\n- Having elevated fat\n- Fasting plasma lipids: low HDL and triglyceride levels along with elevated LDL.", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\nThe NICE guidelines are based on:\n- The most recent evidence base\n- The most important recommendations\n- The findings of expert surveys, guidelines based on experience from national and international organisations, studies conducted with representative populations, and studies of people at particular risk for the specific disease\n- The evidence base for the type of heart disease that each person is at risk, or likely to be affected\nNICE then determines which areas and risk groups are high, low or unknown, and then it develops the next best practice pathway for people to improve their risk factor status, reduce their risk of CVD, or reduce the amount of disease they have.\nWhat does this mean for you?\n- You know the type of heart disease that you are at risk for;\n- You know the type of heart disease \u2013 if you are at low risk for type A (hypertensive), high risk for type B \u2013 if you are at high risk for both types is dependent on the lifestyle that you can make changes. Most of the time there will be lifestyle change that will reduce your risk of CVD, not only for type A and type B but for all types.\nThe best ways to stop and reverse CVDs or prevent it include:\n- Get regular weight loss via healthy eating and exercise (or better yet, a balanced calorie diet for those in which you are overweight if you have diabetes),\n- Lower blood pressure naturally, not medication that will reduce blood pressure by as much as a hundredfold,\n- Manage blood pressure more effectively,\n- Check your cholesterol \u2013 do not believe what others tell you; measure your cholesterol levels regularly, regularly! High cholesterol is considered risk factor 1, and as the risk of CVDs increases, the cholesterol rises.\nTo further reduce your risk of CVD, you can reduce your overall level of cholesterol, fat, and saturated fat (eaten by saturated fats, found in red meat like beef, pork, mutton and lamb; fried food; butter; biscuits and cakes) because it is believed that high LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) in particular increases your risk of CVD. To reduce the burden of stroke and peripheral artery disease, you can reduce your LDL cholesterol, triglycerides (the kind of fat which is made up by these people but is more difficult for the body to break down), blood glucose levels, levels of blood pressure, blood fats, blood calcium, and blood clotting.\nNICE also advise that if you have a risk factor that is too high to reduce or is still too high to stop smoking or use tobacco, then you should discuss your treatment with your NICE prescriber.\nWhat is your heart, please?\nWhen you come out to heart service, are there people on your ticket who can help?\n- Your doctor \u2013 a cardiologist, a vascular surgeon, an electrophysiologist, or a cardiac surgeon and cardiovascular nurse practitioner \u2013 will work one-to-one with you.\n- A nurse practitioner will help with both prescribing medication and making sure you understand any changes with the medication you are taking at the appointment.\n- Other people who will be making changes to your daily routine \u2013 this could include you, your family, and friends who may be able to support, as well as someone who can monitor your progress.\n- A support person \u2013 this could be a GP or your local hospital social worker.\nWhat is it like being able to support you in this?\nAfter a cardiac event, it is difficult to say how someone will feel, especially if they are just starting to feel healthy. People going through this can come and go in different ways throughout the appointment, and this is what makes your journey very personal.\nYou bring some of the things that you feel like you can\u2019t say to someone that they have a heart problem, or talk about your side of the family when you are having a meeting.\nThe other part of this experience is not very positive and people may not understand what you are going through. It is also not something that you should make an excuse to be out because someone has asked you to come in, because you were there already, you are still too late, or because you haven\u2019t felt any better yet. It is important not to accept that you are going through something like this. No matter how hard you try to be kind to someone, it is not a way of living or a way of responding to someone else\u2019s heart pain; it is a way of surviving.\nThis is why it is so important to know the difference between a heart problem and what is going on with your heart.

One possible explanation for his current BMI is a previous history of heart disease and hypertension. Although his total cholesterol and HDL levels are above or very close to normal, he's also a smoker and he has diabetes.\n\nYour best bet may be to reduce both his total cholesterol and LDL levels, but not to eliminate the risk entirely. At least a 40% reduction of his lipids would have already reduced his risk. The following is another way to reduce your risk for CVD: keep active. You may have noticed that you're in good shape and smoking is a problem, but if your heart problem is so bad you're willing to do something risky just to get off that thing and live longer, that may be the only way you keep your risk low.\n\nOf course, just since you've got these risk factors (like coronary artery disease, stroke, diabetes, and hypertension, you've already given up much of the risk). Also, you may not be able to improve your cholesterol level just by losing weight. In fact, I wouldn't recommend any kind of diet or lifestyle intervention for this kind of person. For example, no exercise, no medications, and there would be no difference.\n\nJohn's history of coronary artery disease is probably not anything to worry about. However, he should still be checked regularly and be followed closely. If he's still taking statin medications or is on medications that raise cholesterol levels (a little bit of it, I'd say), he should be looked at more closely and given a little diet and exercise plan. Also, if your new lipid recommendations make it seem that he has \"just-around-the-clock\" risk for CVD, you need to look into the whole \"cure\" for he has it all. The fact that it's all bad and this person's risk is so high is not helpful, unless they see that all of these things are not working - and even if they do, it might not be worth using them the whole time.\n\n\u2022 What are the guidelines for preventing heart disease, and if so, why is that not the same as preventing cardiac arrest? Can you help me to narrow this down? Apr 1, 2021 at 7:57\n\u2022 I have some more experience with my client when it comes to exercise. I always recommend a bit of moderate to aerobic movement to get him/her started. He seems to be a good patient who responds to small walks every few days (like walking 3 miles over the weekend). Once he recovers that he will be able to sit out a bit longer at his desk and maybe pick something up from the gym. Aug 28, 2020 at 15:26\n\nA little later, John's recent cholesterol values is:225 mg/dL, 600 mg/dL, 1000 mg/dL.\n\nIf his cholesterol levels are higher that 220, and if John had not been taking statins (or at least not for ten years), then his treatment may have been successful enough to have him see a doctor who can have a second opinion about his cholesterol levels right now.\n\nYour risk is quite high with age, so a \"more age risk\" will probably just be a \"better risk\" and you will need to monitor your cholesterol at regular intervals, as there is a risk of developing a cardiovascular disease or other condition that you cannot control.\n\n\u2022 It is likely that your risk is a bit raised from the usual age of 30 (though to give only one example, my 25-year-old son did not have the problem after he was 13 years old). Jun 26, 2021 at 11:06\n\u2022 My advice for anyone wanting to add an LDL to their cholesterol score would be to take a cholesterol reading over the past four years and look at your cholesterol profile. A recent LDL level 113mg/dL is high in this fashion as is more than double that number. (I know that most people who are 40-65 years old have a high LDL, and take statins). If you still have a risk level you didn't measure in that number, then it seems that your cholesterol is still the one thing you need to worry about.

I can't help that.\n\nSo what's important?\n\n\u2022 I think the questions are a bit too big for a simple analysis. The only way to make a conclusion with this data set is to say that the people who have a CHD had a lower-than-typical CVD risk compared to others who don't have CHD. That doesn't necessarily mean we're putting people in or out of the risk category, but it may be a pretty good indication.\n\n\u2022 I would say you have to think about whether this is a direct causal relation, and whether it is at least marginally non-causal (the data are being sampled in a way that's really likely to result in causation)? That's difficult to say, but your own definition of 'causal' is that I can't help that.\n\n\u2022 @user430842 I assume you are saying that the people in the group for whom mortality has been cut down over the last 15 years should be considered lower-risk as there is a greater risk. In your case the data show that there were an 11% risk difference between the control group and the group who did not have a CHD. What if the group was split into more \"high risk\" and less \"at-risk\"? It looks like you're probably trying to do some further study to see if CHD risk is in fact a causal relation. That would be the whole point of the study anyway, not answering the direct question.\n\n\u2022 There is a possibility that it is causal, perhaps you are referring to one-factor analyses of the data \u2013 you can't answer the question directly and that's why it makes sense to be careful in what you say.\n\n\u2022 Of course, there is the risk associated with having a CHD (although it is small compared to smoking), but that does not necessarily imply that your risk is the same as (or comparable to) someone who doesn't have CHD.", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD? It would do, because the NICE guideline on risk factors is as follows:\n- Smoking - Current or former: More than 15 Cigarettes per day, or up to 30 Pools of Tar or 15 Pools of Liquid Tobacco or 12 Pools of Liquor\n- Physical Activity\n- Body Mass Index\n- Body Weight\n- Other lifestyle variables (e.g., income, smoking, alcohol consumption - if present)\n- Diet, or\n- Use alcohol - for example, one large glass or two (or 100 ml) of wine per day\n- Body composition (e.g., lean (healthy) or obese)\n- Age, sex, and ethnicity (including smoking history)\n- Family history in blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose\n- History of depression or anxiety\n- Medical conditions (e.g., Type 2 diabetes, or other metabolic syndrome)\n- History of cardiovascular disease (CVD)\n- History of any chronic or infectious diseases\n- A prior low-dose aspirin treatment for a first-degree relative (e.g., a parent or sibling)\n- Family history of heart attack, or a family history of CAD (i.e., the first-degree relative has a history of CAD and/or an inherited disorder that makes you susceptible to CAD)\n- A family history of diabetes, high blood pressure, or abnormal lipids\n- A family history of hypertension, or any cardiovascular disorder (e.g., family history of coronary heart disease or arterial plaque rupture)\n- Current smoking - current smokers may continue to smoke cigarettes or might have quit by a subsequent cessation attempt [or, of course, they might have not tried to quit, but still smoked].\n- Family history of a first-degree relative who has had a myocardial infarction.\n- A family history of CAD\nA NICE guideline on prevention of coronary artery disease has a useful section on cholesterol\n(http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00000161?id=20045435).\nNICE suggests: All the following are necessary to reduce the amount of fatty acids in the diet: the amount of saturated foods (for example, meat), saturated fats (for example, cheese), dairy milk, whole eggs, poultry, and some seafood. These fats increase the bad cholesterol (LDL), and reduce good cholesterol (HDL) and triglyceride (C-H).\nAlso: The following (see the list of items in the following table), can all help to reduce LDL cholesterol:\n- Foods to avoid (e.g., fried foods, white bread and other bread, fast food/snack)\n- Foods that contain oils (e.g., olive oil, avocado, nut (butter contains trans fat; see Nutrition section))\n- Dairy milk (unless it is fortified). Dairy milk has not been associated with an increased risk of CAD and has cholesterol-lowering, beneficial effect in the diet.\n- Sugar-free (or low-fat) drinks, including juice, soda, and coffee, and sugar-free candies and gum\n- High-fat foods, including fried food, fatty meats, fried desserts, canned sardines, canned tuna, fatty fish, and frozen dinners with salt, high-sodium canned vegetables\nMany of these foods make us obese, so we have a lot of weight (BMI = body mass index) and a lot of fat (e.g., fat-containing tissues, e.g., subcutaneous fat layers, fatty tissue, liver, and bone). These adipose tissue is a source of extra fat that builds on the interior (intestines) of the body, and the extra fat contributes to CAD, the leading cause of death in the United States.\nSome of these foods could be eliminated from your diet, e.g., junk food, fast food, and packaged foods. I suggest:\n- If you're eating fast food - it is better if it is packaged, but if you are not, stick to the store menu.\n- If you eat processed foods, use the ones labeled as \"low-fat\". If you want \"low-fat\" yogurt, use skim milk. It does not lose nutrients from skim milk when skimmed, that's why you will get a lot of health benefits -- it removes the fat.\nThere are many high-fat food groups that also benefit (some of the others can make us obese).

G., eds.).\n- According to a recent Mayo Clinic study, high glucose levels can increase the risk of not only heart disease but cancer as well.\nAs Dr. Gee noted, the HbA1c scale shows how well your body is managing your blood sugar and not how ill-equipped your cells are to manage it. In fact, a recent study suggests that more than 90% of Americans have some stage one impaired glucose metabolism.\n\"People with a healthy HbA1c value will have a better grip on their disease,\" says Dr. Gee. \"What\u2019s really happening is the cells don\u2019t respond as well to the extra glucose as they would if they\u2019d got the blood sugar as it came in that day.\"\nWhat are the symptoms of high blood pressure if you have diabetes?\nThe best way to stay well is to get regular medical checkups and work your way down the blood pressure ladder. So, here\u2019s what you\u2019ll hear about:\n- High blood pressure affects nearly one in five adults.\n- If you\u2019re wondering how to know if your blood pressure is high, the American Heart Association suggests looking for four readings from your blood pressure monitor. If your readings lie in the middle of the range, it\u2019s important check for high blood pressure, said The Asthma & Allergy Foundation of America. For people at risk, they\u2019ll talk about five high blood pressure numbers. To put that into perspective, for the average man over the age of 65, this equates to 138/89 mmg and for the average woman over the age of 45, 117/78 mmg, although someone younger than that can have as much as 154/66 mmg. (NIA; 2008).\n- A single high blood pressure reading is considered the risk factor. According to the AHA, if the upper number reaches 130/80, then it\u2019s considered dangerous and should be investigated. And, if the lower number comes in at 90/69, the cause of the danger is hypertension. So, it\u2019s important to note that, even if your readings are fine, you should always check in with your doctor if you\u2019ve been diagnosed with or experienced high blood pressure.\n- If your readings are on the \u201chard\u201d side, these are a sign of early disease signs. So, your blood pressure could be related to other risks, such as an enlarged heart or lung disease.\n- A third of people with elevated blood pressure have no symptoms. This is why it\u2019s very important to get regular check-ups, says The American Heart Association, just as it was for stroke, high blood pressure, and heart disease, said The AHA. But, it is also crucial to pay attention to any signs that you\u2019re at risk for developing high blood pressure in the future. \u201cHigh blood pressure is a major cause of heart disease,\u201d Dr. Gee explains. It\u2019s the number that can cause high blood pressure years down the line, so it\u2019s always worth checking your numbers if you\u2019ve been diagnosed with, or have had, high blood pressure.\n- If your readings fall in between the hard and easy lines, you probably have a good kidney. A kidney score is not important if the readings fall in the hard and soft lines or fall in the soft line category. But if your readings are on either type, even if there was no change in your kidney score, it can be a good idea to check it regularly. (NIA; 2014)\n- If your readings fall in the hard or soft lines, you\u2019re either at risk for heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or risk of having a stroke. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to lose your kidney (and even your sight) or cut your life. Check your numbers if you\u2019re not sure what your risk is.\n", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\nFor the diagnosis, determine the CVD risk factors\n- Blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg\n- Total cholesterol < 200 mg/dL\n- High HDL cholesterol < 45 mg/dL\n- HDL cholesterol > 60 mg/dL\n- Total cholesterol > 114 mg/dL\nTo know the severity of the CVD risk, perform the following tests:\n- Cardiac catheterization and echocardiogram\n- Angiogram and Doppler Doppler\n\"A cardiologist could determine the severity of the cardiological disease and recommend that patients follow a prescribed treatment,\" says a previous patient from China.\nFrom the perspective of patient, for each patient, the intensity of the risk factors would depend on two factors -\na) age and height in years, and\nb) weight in kilogram.\nFor John, it is about a 27-year-old man who lives in Beijing city and weighs 180-200 pounds - a BMI of 35.95 that is lower than the 30-point limit.\nFor John, he has had diabetes for more than 40 years, he is physically active, he has a tendency to smoking, and he drinks at least one alcoholic beverage a day.\n\"John does not have cholesterol 100mg per mL blood, high triglycerides or hypercholesterolemia.\"\nJohn's risk factors are all risk factors for CVD. He has a large waist circumference, blood pressure >90, blood pressure >135/85 mmHg and triglycerides >180 mg /dL and is physically active, he has a tendency of smoking, and he drinks regularly.\nFor the purpose of taking care of John, we have an algorithm that can help us treat a patient at the right time, which is the patient's age and height in years, as well as the type of CVD risk factor (type 2 diabetes, smoking status, etc.), and that person is physically active. These are just some of the parameters, not the most important element.\nIn order to provide a clear picture of John's risks, heart complications, and other cardiovascular medical conditions, the next step is to develop a complex algorithm that can analyze the individual's risk factors based on data from various sources, and that algorithm would provide recommendations to each person, and then monitor and adjust the intervention.\nThat approach is what doctors and cardiologists developed to help John in treating the patient and reduce his risk of heart attacks.\n\"According to the algorithm, the patients with a BMI of 35.95, high triglyceride (45 mg / dl) and high blood pressure (114/61 mmHg) may be prescribed diet. To reduce the cholesterol value of 200 mg / dl, patients should eat in small portions of food, drink less alcoholic beverage and get exercise.\nThe next step of John's treatment and health goal involves the use of medications that can reduce his LDL cholesterol, which has a major impact on the progression of cardiovascular disease. For John, a study indicates that \"Sclerodin can lower LDL cholesterol.\" And according to a study of a total of more than 4000 patients with chronic diseases in China, a total of 60 mg/dL reduction in LDL cholesterol was achieved.\n\"So he has 27 years,\" and \"he has a BMI >165.45. And this is 65mg/d.\n\"With Sclerodin in China, the amount of medication and dosage is quite small. So if you're looking for 22 mg/dL and someone has no known risk factors, it's better to start at 60 mg/d and increase to 80 mg/d.\nWe will have a very detailed calculation with each person. But for today, we'll start with 50 mg/d and go for 500 mg/d, depending on the patient's age and height. And we will have a detailed calculation with each person and that number will be compared again, so we are still in a process of the implementation.\"\nIt is also important to note that John's risk of heart disease according to the algorithm is similar to that of the previous patient, so the algorithm will be applied once the current data is analyzed for the purpose of determining the right time to start the heart disease treatment.\nJohn's medical history and the risk factors mentioned above would also be evaluated in order to choose the best", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\nI've heard that cholesterol is primarily a product of liver, yet no one has mentioned the role of the liver in the prevention of CVD. A liver-healthy diet may also help to prevent type 2 diabetes.\nThere may be additional heart-healthy nutrients in foods. The Mediterranean diet, for instance, is high in omega-3 fatty acids, and research suggests it plays a role in preventing heart disease.\n\"What I really see is that what we do here in the [American Heart Association] is we're trying to get the average lifestyle. We're trying to get those very healthy lifestyle choices and then we look at heart health and try to build these communities [to help] people make these changes,\" says Malki, who has published the leading evidence on the Mediterranean-type diet \u2014 and in a clinical trial published in the Journal of the American Heart Association \u2014 and is president of the University Center for Medical Health and Health Services at the University of California, San Francisco. To that end, she teaches for the Institute of Life Sciences, and manages a research and clinical program at the Institute and has the expertise to make new discoveries and lead clinical trials.\n\"The idea is they're trying to bring an entire set of diets together,\" she explains. \"You might have a type of diet, but if you can get out that diet in a healthy, varied way you can actually see improvements to your health.\"\nThere may be other nutrients, too, that also play a role in heart health, like folate and omega-3 fatty acids that may also influence cholesterol metabolism.\nThe \"healthy\" diet recommendations in Malki's book include:\n- Eating as little as 803 calories per day\n- Eating a minimum of 20 oz. of dairy products\n- Eating only the least processed foods\n- Eating less red meat and more fish and poultry\n- Eating less sweets and alcohol\n- Taking supplements\n- Eating more whole grains\nMalki points out that these recommendations may change as new evidence becomes available.\n\"There's little doubt in my mind that in terms of diet... it also has tremendous implications in diabetes prevention,\" she says. \"It also makes a lot of sense that there are a lot fewer calories in the Mediterranean than the rest of the world and that we can get in those calories and stay with that diet we have with the Mediterranean diet.\"", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\n- And what about his cholesterol levels? He falls into the high risk range of 180-199.\n- And what about his blood pressure? He is 180/100 mmHg, is 120 systolic and 80 diastolic (120 systolic and 80 diastolic = 130 systolic and 80 diastolic).\n- How about his HDL, LDL and triglyceride levels?\n- We have the data from the European Cardiovascular Risk Score.\n- We had the following:\n- If the individual's score is < 55 as defined by the EU-28, we assume a blood lipid level of < 53 mmol/L in someone with 2,000 mg/L HDL and > 80 mg/dL in someone with 2,000 and > 1 000 mg/L LDL and < 112 mg/dL in someone with 2,000 mg/L HDL and 43 mg/dL in someone with 2,000 mg/L and less than 112 mg/dL, as the threshold for a target.\n- If the individual's score is > 2 and < 3, we assume a blood lipid level > 5% (HDL is above 60) and < 5% (< 3%) for someone with 2.6kg/day or less, that is, < 45mg/dL.\n- If a total cholesterol of 44.5- 48, then our threshold of a target is 125, < 125 and we want to target HDL to the maximum 80 and thus < 300, with a target of > 40.\n- For people with a 0% (normal) blood lipid level, our goal is 400- 410 mg/dL, because we would like the HDL-cholesterol to be more than 50.\n- For someone with an average or high dose of cholesterol (more than 140 mg/dL), the threshold is 335- 375mg/dL, which means they would be a high risk of CVD.\n- And for someone with a 5% HDL concentration (as you can imagine) and > 60 mg/dL LDL (LDL), their target is 45- 48 g/L and their target cholesterol level is < 350 mg/dL.\n- For someone with a 335- 400 mg/dL target cholesterol, our goal is 240- 320 mg/dL, so we must exceed 80 mg/dL.\nSo for people with baseline lipids of 220 to 270 mg/dL and above, we have a 90% risk that they have CVD, and it's not necessarily a high risk. For someone, who has a 150 to 240 mg/dL, our target would be 250 mg/dL or 37%.\n- The threshold for someone is 315 mg/dL, and if he/she has a target cholesterol level of < 200 mg/dL (below is not a goal) our goal is 300 mg/dL.\nSo the key is to make sure the individual and family are following the risk limit and keeping a close eye on their cholesterol and blood pressure, and if there are additional triggers, we think this should also be implemented for the individual and family as well, so that we have more success for the individual.\nSo while the target for CVD does depend on who you are, so it should be very carefully considered for each individual.", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\n1 out of every 10 (6.2%) deaths in the UK each year is attributable to CHD. An estimated half of those deaths are caused by HBP, but most HBP deaths are caused by other life-threatening diseases such as heart attack and stroke.\nThe good news is, there are many things you can do to reduce your risk of developing heart diseases and CHD (it's even harder to avoid them in some populations), including:\n- Don't smoke. There is no evidence that smoking does anything to lower your risk of any condition.\n- Do your maths. Most CVD deaths occur at some point in the last 20 years. The greatest risk factor is 35 or older.\n- Be at healthy BMI (Body Mass Index). BMI is a simple way to assess your body fat. An ideal BMI is 18.5 - 24.9.\n- Have a healthy diet. Avoid eating too much saturated fat, sugar, salt and alcohol.\n- Eat enough vegetables. A diet with lots of fruit and vegetables could reduce your risk of CHD.\n- Limit caffeine, which increases your risk of CHD. The intake of caffeine is higher with heavier coffee and tea drinkers - as much as three to four cups per day, on average, will keep high blood pressure at bay.\n- Exercise. Regular physical activity for at least 30 minutes a day is important, but is particularly important when you are already at risk of heart disease.\n- Be mentally active. Regular exercise and a change of routine can reduce your risk of CHD, and can help you enjoy older age more fully.\n- Lower your blood pressure. Lower your systolic blood pressure (\"total\" or major) by half over at least six months.\n- Quit smoking. Quitting smoking stops HBP and CHD by about 80%.\n- Lose weight. Most non-smokers have a slightly higher risk of cardiovascular disease than smokers.\n- Get a good night's rest. Sleep well with at least three to four hours per night. This gives your body time to recover from stressful activities.\n- Have regular sex. Sex reduces the risk of heart attacks and CHD.\n- Manage your stress. Some people report less stress on average about two years after quitting smoking, or between four to six years after quitting alcohol. Your heart takes longer to recover and so your risk of heart attack or stroke is raised.\n- Take your medicines. Many drugs prescribed to people with CHD reduce their risk of heart attack and CHD. But they also do not cure the problem, so you might not experience all the benefits.\nA simple diet and healthy lifestyle factors can affect your risk of developing heart disease. Smoking can put you at greater risk, so avoid smoking if you have already been advised to do so. If you're regularly exposed to secondhand smoke, or are over-age smokers, quitting may be even more difficult.\nThe good news is there are lots of ways to help you try to achieve that healthy lifestyle!\n- Talk to your GP or nurse.\n- Get information and support in your area. For some people, there are people and organisations (for example, heart based charities) that can assist with your care.\n- Read about CHD and see what people have to say about it.\n- Eat less salt, less saturated fat and more veggies, fruit and wholegrain cereal.\nA heart-healthy diet may help lower your risk of heart disease in middle age. Studies have shown that a diet high in fruit and vegetables, lean protein, wholegrain and low in salt reduces the risk of heart disease. What's more, a healthy diet with less saturated fat can lower the risk of stroke and heart attack in older people.\nGetting enough physical activity is also important. If you have a sedentary job, it is important that you stay physically active. It can also help you lose weight. For most people the best way to do it is if walking is the main source of your exercise, or you can find ways to do something different you enjoy.\nAs you have grown older your lifestyle will change. You will need your heart to continue to work well, so you'll have to try to keep fit.\nIt's also important to make sure your doctor is aware that you have had a heart attack. Talk to your doctor about what steps you need to take to help manage your health. They could be:\n- Taking steps you have been doing yourself.

You have only used an idea, because you can't be confident about the result.\n\nA 15-year-old male with a 70-cm BP and 2.5 g/dl could measure a normal value in that person of 25-60%. Not likely to be a good idea, when you are not even sure about what the ideal is.\nUpvotes: 2 username_2: You could go with the following 5-step algorithm. The only caveat is that in most of the applications I've seen, the algorithm uses the ideal 25-30% (but there are exceptions, if you choose) and may not give a good estimate if the person is resting or has been sitting for a very long period. \n\n**Step 1:** Calculate age, sex, and race using your medical record. Then subtract the age (for example: for a 25-year-old, they'd be 25) and sex. (But sex is a 100%). Add the race to get number of races and put the result in your age.\n\n**Step 2:** Convert all races to U.S. values. The older the person, the more likely you are to have higher U.S. values. That assumes that the person is already classified as \"red\" -- that they are physically active (think of walking to the store, going to the bathroom, etc.) and are not getting too sick and/or injured. They won't be.\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the best estimate for resting heart rate, using your medical record. If the best estimate doesn't look right (say your best estimate for the best is 114 beats per minute; say you use the 60 beats per minute to be correct, and your best estimate for is 106 beats per minute, you have a 1/3 chance of not being close to the best estimate, or worse, being closer to the best estimate). If the best estimate for the best is correct, then the person still needs to be measured in the rest space, which I don't think is entirely accurate for many people. Make sure you use accurate measurements. If you feel you should be close to the best estimate if you have a healthy heart, make sure you take the measurements. (If you think you will get near your best estimate, make sure you are not doing that because you might make a mistake when taking measurements).\n\n**Step 4:** If a normal value is derived from your medical record, add that to your age and sex. Then subtract your age from 30.\n\n**Step 5:** If you have a new medical record, get it back now. If the new medical record is negative (indicate that it is below normal), multiply by the lowest cut-off value. If you see something positive (indicate that it is higher than normal), cut off the number. Then subtract your age again. Then add the cut-off value you calculated in step 4.\n\nIt is really easy to get wrong in these steps. For example: when you measure a 25-year-old, the best estimate for the best is 114 beats per minute (100%), so if you measure 20 years old, you would be 20 beats per minute -- 114 beats per minute (the number in red). You need the cut-off point (20 if you measure 20) and when you calculate, it doesn't look very good. The best estimate for someone who was at least 20 in their own bed could be 98:2; and a 70-year-old who was sitting up in bed would be 100:2, so it doesn't look so good.\n\nIf you have a medical record from only a year ago... 9 years ago, but you look over the last 20 years, you could", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\nPlease note that as the name suggests not all these patients will be good candidates for a standard drug intervention.

John may already be meeting all of the following:\n- The 2018 National Health Interview Survey showed that over half of all men and women in the UK are still classified as at moderate to extremely high risk for CVD.\n- About a third have at above 20% risk levels.\n- About 19% of men and women meet the 20% to 50% risk levels.\n- It is thought that men account for more of the risk of most cancers than women.\n- There are 339 cases of new malignant heart diseases each year in the UK.\nIn terms of how John's lifestyle might be affected, people might be more aware of high risk areas (for example: high blood pressure or high cholesterol). This might help to guide him towards adopting some lifestyle changes. However, John probably has no information on current lifestyle recommendations, so as to be as prepared as possible as to what lifestyle changes might work to reduce risk.\nAs his exercise is not monitored by a GP but instead by his family, John may be more likely to become a little physically unfit, for example. This may help to increase blood fats.", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\nJohn has an overall age of 33 and a BMI of 24 in the early stages of CVD development, and has had previous history of heart attacks and strokes. Also, there is a history of diabetes and smoking.\nJohn's other risk factors are also all of the above and therefore would not be fit to participate in this study. Furthermore, the average duration of his disease progression is 20 years (he has two of four known CVDs: coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, or stroke) and there is no evidence to suggest that he has a genetic predisposition to CVD.\nJohn should still consider participating in the study with his own insurance and be aware that there is potential for insurance loss as heart attacks may occur during the course of the study if he does not take aspirin.\nThis study is designed to provide access to data on potential risk factors for high-risk, asymptomatic patients with a history of CVD. In addition, this study is designed to examine potential for patients with a history of CVD who are no longer symptomatic to increase the overall burden of study use.\nThe study will include a total enrollment in 29,848 participants over a 21-year period. If the study population meets the inclusion criteria in an appropriate way, the trial will enroll at least 200 eligible individuals in parallel, in a study design that reduces the non-random assignment of individuals to comparison groups (a propensity score method) but allows for randomization to take place in each participant's trial. Each participant will be randomly assigned to an experimental arm (with one treatment) and an experimental arm (control). If the study population satisfies the inclusion criteria, the trial will have enrolled at least 200 participants in a study design that decreases the non-random assignment of individuals to treatment comparison groups. Each participant will be randomly assigned to an experimental arm or a control arm (with and without one treatment) and a separate study arm.\nThe purpose of all information provided to individuals, as well as the participants, is to support patients, and, for those patients that wish to enroll, to participate, to prevent further CVD progression, and/or to enroll at least 200 participants in a study design that reduces the non-random assignment of participants in the study.\nIf the study population meets the inclusion criteria in an appropriate way, the trial will enroll at least 200 eligible participants in a study design that reduces overall study use and risk of bias in study participants who are not eligible to participate or have no known CVD risk factors. When the study enrolls 200 or more study participants, more information is sent to the investigators and the study will be accepted for enrollment.\nAll of the study participants have been notified by their health care provider and will receive an email informing them of the study start date. This email will be sent to all participating individuals (but not to everyone), with instructions for providing demographic information of the patient (age, sex (male or female), and BMI). Individuals that attend at least 1 of the 2 phases will be asked to provide a copy of the email. Those who do not complete the study enrollment forms but still want to participate will be advised to review the study recruitment information, and then to complete a questionnaire provided by the sponsor, to confirm that they are a suitable candidate to participate. The participant will receive a letter of consent to complete the study enrollment forms provided by the prospective service, from the sponsor or their representative, for immediate use.\nIf the study reaches a decision to enroll, the follow-up studies (studies involving the control group) will be initiated. The follow-up studies are different than the clinical studies and are designed for patients with either 1 or 2 CVD.\nPatients' participation in this study is voluntary and will be monitored. If the participant's participation increases more than 300% over previous follow-up periods, the study will initiate a second follow-up study. Patients continue to be referred to this study and to ongoing studies for additional data on their cardiovascular disease risk factors after the study is concluded.\nStudy Objectives: For both the clinical and follow-up studies, the primary aims of the study are to (1) analyze the outcomes associated with each of the 220 patients; and (2) evaluate any changes in cardiovascular outcomes between the 2 study arms, provided that the differences between the 2 follow-up arms are clinically significant and not attributable to differences in the individual participant.\nIf the study involves a 40% decrease in overall study duration", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\nAnd how would he get in there? John would take an aspirin and a combination of four pills a day, taking one pill at the time he would get the first dose of aspirin at midnight, which is the recommended time for aspirin use in adults. Then there are other drugs such as warfarin, which are the riskiest drugs to use for CVD prevention among adults.\nA report on coronary heart disease in the US in 1977 found that only two-thirds of all of those found to have coronary heart disease were women. A few decades later, the percentage of women dying of heart disease had sharply increased to 58 per cent.\nJohn Maughan is the co-author of Heart Health Now: Preventing and Treating Heart Disease in Men.

In terms of the current guidelines, he would ideally receive a cardiovascular program designed by me - which would include lifestyle changes (e.g. diet, exercise), medications including statin therapy, if need be, medications for cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, and cancer. He might also be eligible for the more advanced Cardiovascular risk factor classes (e.g. cardiovascular disease type 2 or vascular disease type 1).\n\nI've attached the document which I need on a reference to get to this point, so I will give time to it if it helps.\n\nFirst of all, if John's lifestyle changes (e.g. diet, exercise, etc.) aren't enough, I'd suggest that he do some further research in the field of CVD (e.g. how it gets acquired, or how it is inherited, some aspect of epidemiology). And so, for John's case- study, I'd suggest that, based on the literature and evidence, I'd suggest that the course would be something like this (see Figure 1):\n\nTable 1:\n\nA cardiovascular program targeted to John, based on available literature, which would incorporate lifestyle changes. Each step towards the new goal will be given by a step, which is a number. Step 1 corresponds to lifestyle, which is the same process as in the case of John. All others would need to be modified by John, which is similar to what one would do on a case-study, i.e. in determining what a case-study should look like. These changes are also described above.\n\nFor most of John's lifestyle changes (including diet), lifestyle becomes more and more difficult. Also, since his lifestyle is fairly sedentary, I'd advise that he consider taking some sort of form of weight loss medication - like statin, if needed. His medication would serve the purpose of helping his body deal with the stress of the condition, and thereby have an effect on his body-weight. This would help to reduce/prevent further complications of CVD.\n\nJohn would also think about the time he spends on sedentary/inactivity based on exercise. For example, when does the sedentary man start? Also, will he stop exercising early?\n\nJohn has a BMI of 36 in total (BMI = Body Mass Index). His weight at the age of 48 (before age 35) is 45kg. His waist-to-hip measuring is 50cm. In other words, his waist measurements (total and hanging tcm) is 176cm and 46 cm. His BMI is 35.55, his BMI is 35.62, his waist measurements are both 191cm and 34cm. Now we will look at the different sub-categories of CVD:\n\n**\n\nBased on John's family history, he would probably not have been diagnosed with CVD. He might be genetically predisposed to high cholesterol or blood pressure. But he might not be at a point where these should be screened for CVD, either at home, with some standard medical, or any other screening device, and/or at most having a cholesterol level of 230mmol/l.\n\nSo, his primary risk factors would be high blood pressure and diabetes. Since both of these are modifiable, I wouldn't expect them to be screened for either of these conditions - which may make a difference, depending on his lifestyle, as well as age.\n\n**\n\nBased on John's personal exposure to cholesterol, the current guidelines for CVD prevention are:\n\n**\n\nBased on John's lifestyle, he might be exposed to high rates of hypercholesterolemia. He might also have diabetes, which would also require regular screenings.\n\nBased on the literature, the current guidelines for CVD prevention is:\n\n**\n\nBased on John's lifestyle, he might be exposed to high rates of hypercholesterolemia. He might also have diabetes, so that regular screenings might be part of his current plan.\n\nGiven this, John would probably be able to identify his personal exposure for CVD through this.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFirst of all, John's lifestyle isn't going to change much, unless his BMI is set low for over a few decades. He's still a pretty average height overall, and he has no problems with his family history.\n\nThe bottom line is that John has a very good understanding of how to live a healthy lifestyle.

The patient would likely have the following characteristics: a 5-year record of CKP > <200 mg/dL (1.36 mmol/L), >2000 mg/dL (1.44 mmol/L) LDL cholesterol, >80 mg/dL (5.2 mmol/L) - low HDL cholesterol, <50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) and \u22652000 mg/dL (1.36 mmol/L) >HDL and >100 mg/dL (6.5 mmol/L) of VLDL cholesterol. The patient may have had a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, however her risk of CVD is very low, and there is no evidence to support the clinical diagnosis of coronary heart disease. Her treatment plan would not affect the patient's risk of CVD; there is little or no evidence that the patients should be treated with a statin drug, or low-risk CAD treatment, and there is very little evidence that anti-hyperhomocystinemia, or supplementation with choline is effective in controlling CVD.

All were 65 or older and reported smoking.\nA study in 1994 by Lopes et al.\nconcluded the following:\n- For a 65-year-old man, a myocardial infarction is a risk factor for the development of a new heart attack, so a smoking history might be considered a marker of CVD risk.\n- A 65-year-old man with chronic bronchitis was defined as a COPD diagnosis without a history of tobacco smoking (or tobacco consumption history, in that case).\n- A history of diabetes is a risk factor for CVD, even in young men with other smoking or no smoking history.\n- A history of COPD is a risk factor for hypertension and low-density lipoproteins - a key risk factor for developing CAD. \n- Long-term smokers have a 3 times lower risk of mortality than non-smokers (30%). \nThese studies, however, fail to determine the underlying mechanisms that lead to this relationship.\nIs there a'smoker effect'?\nIn a study by Smith et al.\ninvolving 675 287 adults, no risk of heart disease was found if men and women were non-smokers.\nTheir conclusions showed that, overall, for men, smoking was the 'best' risk factor for the development of heart disease.\nHowever, their results also showed that for women, that risk of heart disease remained unchanged, despite a long term and well documented smoking history.\nThis is possible because smoking tobacco was found to be a \"common\" cause of heart disease.\nIn another study,\n40% of the women (and 55% of men) who were non-smokers of some type who smoked had pre-existing CVD (and 15% already had a history of CVD)\n(12, 16, 27, 28).\nSome research studies even found that 3 out of 4 cases were attributed to smoking.\nSo, the smoking-nicotine pathway seemed to be at least partly the culprit.\nHowever, in another study,\n8% of the women who were smokers, and 11% of her who were non-smokers (and 20% both), tested positive for heavy smoking history.\nThey were not only smokers but also heavy drinkers.\nHowever, it is possible this has a protective effect against heart disease, too.\nIn fact, one study showed that 15-20 years after stopping smoking, there was a reduction in the risk of CAD. \nThis has been taken up more and more recently (in 2009) as a 'healthy-eating paradigm.'\nWe can learn from that (with a long term, well documented smoking history).\nThere was evidence from a study in 2008 that:\n- The risk of death from major general medical conditions, heart disease and cancer fell 24% among women with a smoking history.\n- In older women with a historical smoking history, their heart-related mortality was less than 10.1%\nSo, what has been the most important point for us to learn from studying the smoking-nicotine pathway?\n\"Smokers are not risk-free\"\nOur world is becoming more and more dominated by smokers.\nIn fact, if you look at your habits, your choices, the way you live, you may find that your habits are not healthy.\nYour health is in the cards - but not necessarily in a smoking manner.\nRemember that for decades smoking was not only a leading cause of preventable ailments in the United States (not only smoking itself), but it was also used as a method of control in many other countries too.\nFor example, the French use the French term \"dolor d'aesthetics\" for their health. \nTheir health \"duties\" are health and happiness - and smoking is a sign that you will not get the health", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD? Is this a common pattern of disease, or is it something else that might be more relevant for John's condition?\nJoan: For this specific case, John is no 13 if he is at risk? If this is his condition or if it is something else, who would I consult if, say, John is the only one in the family with a high CVD risk? If there are relatives with high CVD risk, can I give them my information or do I have to be further tested, as I am currently unaware of any data about those at risk?\nJoan: In contrast to the example with John, there is nothing new about identifying familial CVD risk. It is a simple concept for us to determine; high BMI of a particular family can be associated with high risk in each child, and a high cholesterol and blood pressure of a family can be associated with higher CVD risk in each child. However, it is a very general rule; even having a high BMI in a family can be associated with a high CVD risk in offspring, because children of those with the highest BMI are also the highest risk children.\nTherefore, family history is not a definitive explanation of cardiovascular risk, but it is an important factor in our assessment and prevention of cardiovascular disease and so represents an important area in which new interventions addressing those who would not otherwise benefit from risk can be considered.\nWhat about cardiovascular disease in the case of a non family man - John? What would be the role of age, weight, and height, in that case?\nJoan: The two conditions are different. Firstly, the non family man's cardiovascular disease is typically associated with type 2 diabetes. This type of diabetes develops mainly at older ages and over a longer period of time than what is clinically associated with type 2 diabetes in the non family man. Secondly, the non family man's CVD risk is higher than what is associated with type 2 diabetes. This is because the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is higher in younger individuals, with respect to the age of diagnosis. In fact, diabetes develops at a younger age in a non family man when compared to type 2 diabetes, and the longer the age, the higher the risk. This is the same pattern as with the incidence of CVD in the case of heart disease; a smoker is at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease than is the case of no smoking. So what is the association with diabetes seen in the case of a not family man? This type of coronary artery disease is due to a narrowing of the main route to the heart - the coronary arteries. The higher incidence of coronary artery disease is often thought to be caused by atherosclerosis in the face of risk factors for developing atherosclerosis, such as high blood pressure or hypercholesterolaemia. However, it is possible that the risk may be due to atherosclerosis itself in those with a family history of coronary artery disease. For a family to have CVD risk, it is necessary that a coronary artery disease is present at the time of diagnosis. This is also possible with non family diabetes as the development of vascular disease can lead to an increased risk of developing CVD. However, it is not to be thought that diabetes should contribute to the development of such vascular disease; the other risk factors (alcohol) can also contribute to its development, and so the incidence of CAD is higher in individuals who are diagnosed with undiagnosed diabetes.\nSo, we can look at the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery disease in the absence of smoking, both risk factors for developing coronary artery disease - the presence of diabetes. So what we are looking at is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, and the number of deaths in the non family man and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, as well as the existence of some diabetes with a family history of diabetes: hypertension, or hypervenilant diabetes, or both. If the non family brother or the non family member of the disease had a high family history of CAD, CVD, and had pre-existing diabetes, these could be a risk factor for future CVD, as well as the existence of a family history of CVD. However, one needs to remember that when these individuals have a family history of MI or coronary artery disease, they also carry a high incidence of pre-existing diabetes, which is one of the risk factors for CVD. In the patient with hypertension, then, it is possible for these individuals to be at risk for developing coronary artery disease, but they do not have an increased risk of developing the disease that leads to a heart attack, a CV event, etc", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD? He also does well on medications, as he has been taking 200 mg of a statin medication every day. The patient is not on medication for a health related reason. Is there a potential relationship between these measurements and risk factors for CVD? What is the potential treatment? Is there a risk of new cases of CVD? If so, is this the appropriate treatment? Since it is the first visit the patient is scheduled, I would say the best choice would be to use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) to lower his cholesterol levels, since he is not currently on therapy for his previous risk. I have heard that aspirin used to lower LDL cholesterol has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease. It makes sense that aspirin could be used to lower his cholesterol levels, as it was shown that people using this medication are still at risk for having an incident myocardial infarction and other events. In order for the patient/client to have a reduction in his risk of CHD and the subsequent incidence of CHD when doing at home following this, it seems logical that they should be taking other preventive measures such as a good diet, 7 days/week of exercise, and getting regular preventive screenings.\nWhat is the best estimate of how much he will weigh if he continues to smoke?\nWhat would he need to eat if he weighs 250 pounds to be in this weight range if she was sedentary (low physical activity)?

And, what is the clinical implication of those recommendations? (I don\u2019t really see what the medical community is looking for.)\n\u201cThe guideline authors wrote that we should use the term \u2018interventions\u2019 to represent \u2018modalities\u2019 \u2014 which may mean things like lifestyle changes, physical activity, tobacco cessation, cessation of stress and so on. One area that did shine in this latest update is smoking cessation. So far it\u2019s been fairly consistent in recommending smoking cessation and physical activity as primary risk factors for CVD. But that may have changed,\u201d says Poonawalla. \u201cModalities may include things like talking about quitting \u2014 which would actually be a really important tool because a lot of people are resistant to giving up \u2014 or trying for a medication. Smoking cessation may, for example, be a good start if everyone in the community has high degrees of cardiovascular risk.\u201d\nHe also says that one of the goals of NICE is to identify the \u201cnon-medical\u201d measures that are the most effective. For example, to develop the NICE Guidelines on the evaluation and management of cardiac exercise intolerance, which I think would be very important for people wishing to go for an exercise prescription.\nSo it\u2019s important that people aren\u2019t just doing some exercises, which of course isn\u2019t a health risk.\n\u201cWe have a very strong focus on the health outcomes in CVD,\u201d says Poonawalla. \u201cSo we\u2019re working to reduce that burden of dying, and I think that\u2019s an important goal. We\u2019ve really focused on all the ways you can reduce CVD \u2014 the health care system, the economy, the lifestyle we want to change that creates health inequalities by some measure. In the next stage of the modelling exercise (in 2021), the authors want to see the effects, whether we can actually measure them and whether they\u2019re able to show a benefit in terms of saving lives or reducing cost.\u201d\nThat could take some more work, says Poonawalla. \u201cWe look at all those potential benefits \u2026 and what is the clinical impact?\u201d\nIt\u2019s been great to see the review be supported by NICE \u2014 which has given us the opportunity to comment on potential benefits or to provide the evidence to the reviewers themselves, as well as to the public, researchers and other clinicians.

What kinds of things should I post about myself (as a blog)?\nA: I am posting from my blog so the answers to these are not necessarily mine. If so, I have a 350M viewers. If not, I have another 300-400M followers on the network.\n12.Which heart disease expert do you seek out for your research? If so, what expert did you receive your heart disease education? What aspects of the knowledge did you acquire from this lecture?\nA: Dr. Alessio Fasano.\n12.What research-based information do you subscribe to? If you are currently subscribed to a journal subscription, where would you apply the knowledge you received when I write about your topic?\nA: From my experience, I have used the following books as I have reviewed them by the author: A Practical Guide to the Heart's Blood Supply by Stephen G. Stoner; The Heart and Circadian Biology by Joseph M. Albrecht; The Human Cardiovascular System, Heart Circulation, and Stroke by S. E. Magee; The Heart in the Brain by F. N.

Why do more people have heart disease by and large older than people of younger age?\nA: Older people have thicker and less elastic arterial walls. This makes it more difficult to pump blood through the heart and the circulatory system.\n14 (for a 50-year-old, 440-year-old, or over seven hours old, I would be surprised.)\n15.How can older people help prevent heart disease and strokes?\nA: Everyone should take part in activities that will help them stay healthy as they get older.\n15 (For a 50-year-old who has 90 years of cardiac activity and history of heart failure, I would be surprised.)\n16.I am a 50-year-old woman who just recently lost 50% of her body weight. Can you provide information for those people who are concerned?\nA: The National Council on Aging has a list of lifestyle factors for older adults that can be used as tools for prevention of both heart disease and stroke related morbidity and mortality, including: physical training (to improve the balance, flexibility, and strength); diet (to maintain a healthy weight and avoid obesity and eating disorders); smoking cessation; healthy alcohol consumption; and avoiding high-risk behaviors.\n17.What are some ways to measure heart rate?\nA: You could use a heart rate monitor if you know the person.", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\nThere are a number of recommendations about which to focus, and some guidelines are not aligned with the NICE standards. The first recommendation is to increase physical activity (including walking, gardening, and housework) by about 500 minutes per week to reduce cardiovascular risk (the recommendation is \u201cdietary intervention\u201d), and then to reduce total energy intake by 300 kilocalorie per day. There are no specific CVD prevention steps that are recommended in this approach.\nFor 10 years, most doctors, nurses, and the national government have recommended that most adults eat five servings of fruit and vegetables per day. However, few have followed the recommendations for fruit and vegetables. Most doctors recommend a three-ounce size serving of fruit and/or vegetables to reduce CVD risk, based on 500 kilocalorie recommendations. In addition, the recommendations have two additional recommendations that have no support \u2013 for the \u201cobesity\u201d diet and for weight loss in persons with obesity (BMI 30 or higher). In addition, the recommended number of servings of fruit, vegetable, and dairy (35 oz.) has been used as a guideline in the US instead of 5 servings. But what happens when more than 5 servings?!\nThe first example of the \u201cobesity\u201d diet was introduced into America many years ago by an American woman named Betty Friedan. When she and her husband, James, and son used it to promote their home-cooking program, it led to an outbreak of obesity and raised the national number of obesity deaths by 1,600 per year in 1970. Unfortunately, the idea was rejected by the British Medical Association and several other medical authorities. As a result, the recommendations became a national policy and have been made mandatory for many more years, including at the federal level. In 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued this \u201cnew diet\u201d advice. A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in 2013, found that most of the people who ate the recommended amount, the equivalent of three servings of fruit, did so to reduce their CVD mortality. But what about 5 servings of fruit and vegetables? Could that lead to a much less effective advice (or recommendations) to prevent CVD and reduce CVD mortality? As a result, it is now recommended that the recommended amount of servings of fruit and vegetables should be increased \u2013 particularly \u201ccarrots\u201d \u2013 to reduce CVD mortality.\nAlso in this view of CVD prevention, experts and the media have given a warning about the \u201cfat diet\u201d. The \u201cfat diet\u201d is designed to promote weight loss in order to lower cholesterol levels \u2013 such as the one that promoted by the American physician Dr. Robert Wood Johnson. There are no guidelines about what is considered a \u201cfat\u201d person and, of course, the media will take the advice of Dr. Wood Johnson away. These recommendations are also based on low levels of HDL cholesterol (a precursor to CVD \u2013 see here for a discussion). In addition, the recommendations also promote a \u201cbad\u201d fats in general. Studies to date have shown that saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of heart attack, a heart attack is an increased risk of stroke, and a heart attack is an increased risk of heart disease and death, but more research is needed in this area.\nThe \u201cfat diet\u201d was promoted by Dr. Robert Wood Johnson, and the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as something \u201chealthful\u201d for the body to limit the fat in. This advice about limiting saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and trans fat is based on 1614 studies from different types of randomized controlled trials and observational studies. The report published only in one year concludes that this advice lowers total cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood glucose in non-diabetic subjects. It only states that this is a \u201chealthful\u201d advice. In addition, many studies say they support this advice. For example, in a study conducted in the 11th survey, an American study indicated that this practice of restricting saturated fat decreased total CHD risk by a significant amount of 6%. This diet is now known to be effective in preventing heart disease in the majority of studies that have used this diet for various reasons. But what about the more aggressive diet (25% or 50%, on a daily basis, with the goal of reducing to only 20 grams of fat and the remaining to 150 grams of protein), or this advice to avoid all fats", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be? What if I would also need lifestyle therapy? Does that count?\nYou must do a basic assessment, based on the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute guidelines. These are general guidelines that should be used as a starting point, not a hard and fast law. Remember that these guidelines are based on scientific knowledge, and they are not the final word on treatment of CVD.\nAs we get to know a person or a clinical decision, we can do a bit less work than a simple clinical assessment. We need to know their risk factors, their history of cardiovascular disease, and have an objective relationship with their risk factors. We get to do a bunch of simple tests, and look to see whether the person is at risk. This can be done with a simple self-examinatory test, e.g. a normal cholesterol level. We can do a detailed history, together with a physical exam, and test the individual to see if they have other risk factors, e.g. hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.\nIf people have the same symptoms as those with heart disease, then there may be a common risk factor. Our objective would be to determine whether a few common risk factors are the same, or different. I would be asking someone to think of a risk factor together with a more specific one, in order to arrive at a more specific recommendation. I would try to obtain 30 seconds' (informal) of each item listed, so that all the data is collected before the 2 questions are asked. After this, we would look to see if we were close. The more specific our recommendation is, the better. We can't do this every time. That is the rule of thumb in our case.\nI'm going to call these simple interventions, and we can use an example of one of them: a simple exercise program. If you exercise, your blood pressure and cholesterol will decrease. We can do that for just a week, and then repeat the process, if necessary. Or we can just do the exercise test. It really depends on the person's level of fitness, and how much they are willing to do this risk reduction exercise.\nAfter the simple intervention test, we can look at the results together. If what happens is the same, what do we expect to happen? Would it help or hurt the person? Would they notice any changes after the simple exercise routine? Would we still be doing it? Could they follow the exercise? What about a simple lifestyle decision? Could they make lifestyle changes or not, such as not smoking?\nWhat about some individual who, before the intervention, was at a very high risk of CVD? What about 50-year-olds with at least 8 risk factors?\nThe most important first step in improving care of people with CVD is to know their risk factors \u2013 and to know where best to start. We should be taking the information on this disease to people we care about, to inform them about the best ways to maintain their cardiac health.\nThere are already people in England who have been given the same advice about what lifestyle changes we could make to improve their cardiovascular risk over several years, and we can use this information and what we have learned, to inform more people in this area, about lifestyle changes they can make to make a positive difference. The more we know, the better. We all have a responsibility to help others who are in their 70s and beyond become the best people we can be.\nAbout the author\nMichael Marr is a senior consultant in cardiac care at the University of Bedfordshire.

If there are no changes in medication, you should be monitored for these problems regularly.\nTreatments and drugs\nA simple noninvasive approach to treating atrial fibrillation is to use atrial fibrillation-selective suture-repair (ASSR) to treat a smaller portion of the heart tissue.\nA cardiac surgeon will perform an ASSR. These procedures will most likely be an outpatient operation, although you also may be fitted with a pacemaker. If your heart is not beating normally, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator may also be suggested.\nThis is more common in older adults and is intended to replace a faulted or malfunctioning heart muscle. It sends electrical impulses to the heart muscle that may have been damaged.\nThis is a more invasive device called a cardioverter with pacemaker (CVP). This device contains electrodes placed on the body. The chambers of the myocardium are stimulated with small electrical shocks to regulate the electrical impulses sent to the heart from the pacemaker. If electrical instability in the heart is caused by abnormal rhythm, atrial fibrillation is often the problem. There is also potential harm to the implanted heart, such as the possibility of a heart valve replacement or serious damage to a healthy portion of the heart.\nThere is a pacemaker in atrial fibrillation to maintain electrical activity in the heart, but it is usually not used until the fibrillation has been unresponsive to medications.\nAn artificial heart\nIf your heart is unable to beat normally, an artificial heart can be implanted to replace the heart muscle. The implant can be surgically implanted into the body within minutes. The device may then pump muscle tissue from your chest to your lungs so that your heart doesn't beat too strongly at times.\nThe heart may not beat enough to pump blood around the body if there is a blood clot. For this reason, an artificial heart can help prevent heart attacks.\nAn atrial fibrillation pacemaker is not an essential piece of equipment in many general practices, but it may be used to prolong the time between heartbeats and help prevent an arrhythmia.\nThere are different brands of pacemakers available.\n- A total cardioversion is a procedure that uses pacing devices made by the company FACEPAM.\n- A pacemaker that stimulates the heart muscle is a pacemaker that is implanted by an anesthesiologist.\n- A pacemaker is a device that keeps pacemaker electrodes in place under the skin of the chest area. The device can also be implanted in the groin area.\n- The heart is a muscle and a pacemaker can only send electrical impulses to the heart muscle in a way that is meant to affect a certain portion of it.\n- An atrial fibrillation pacemaker may be used in certain heart rhythm disturbances, such as atrial fibrillation that is associated with a dangerous arrhythmia, for emergency cardiac intervention.\n- A cardiac pacemaker is a device designed to regulate the heart's rhythm.\n- You can be discharged from the hospital if you are able to take care of yourself, do not have a family member or friend in your care, or have been treated for an underlying heart condition.\n- You should only be discharged if you feel better and you are able to keep up with your daily routine\n- There are some medications that may require intravenous or intram", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\nQ: What are the common CVD symptoms and how would you assess a patient with or without CVD for a diagnosis of a CVD?\nQ: Explain why a patient referred for a cardiac evaluation should not be treated with medication for heart failure but be referred to a specialist when a person with non-circulatory non-cardiac chest pain is presenting.\nQ: Some of my clients might report fatigue, which may be due to sleep disturbance, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipoproteinemia, or a family history for CVD.

Egan, MD, Chief, Cardiac Rehabilitation Section, BVMHC, and M.S., Department, Epidemiology, NCEP, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Washington, DC.\nFraser received an M.S. in 1999 from Harvard Medical School, Boston, where he had a long career in cardiology. He was a senior fellow of the American College of Physicians and board-certified surgeon at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, as well as an Associate in Medicine with the Mayo Clinic Health System and a National Chair for Patient Safety, in 1997; assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago, Chicago, Medical School; and medical director of the Mayo Heart Center in Tucson, Arizona, where he oversees the medical care of patients diagnosed with heart failure or diagnosed with angina, according to a July 2019 Reuters article.\nFollow the link to contact Fraser.\nFor more information:", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\nAim: To assess the influence of a set of cardiovascular (CV), metabolic (BMI) and non-cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors on coronary artery disease, cardiovascular events, and mortality in asymptomatic and symptomatic type 2 diabetes (T2D) and non-T2D adults aged 60-80 years.\nThe UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) is aimed at exploring the influence of factors, including age, family history of DM, hypertension, obesity, smoking, physical activity, and salt intake on development of diabetes, or non-diabetes risk factors, such as CVD. It is currently seeking participants who are > 70 years of age.\nCardiovascular events include a series of heart attacks or strokes and CHD, but not MI (i.e., acute MI is defined as a chest pain, localised on the left side of the breastbone). The purpose of the CKD study is to assess the influence of CVD on CDE, and it seeks participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and/or who had an annual CVD event history over 27 years, regardless of smoking history. Participants will be recruited using a combination of secondary contact point strategies and convenience sampling and will complete a standard 20-item self-administered online questionnaire.\nWe will use data from this study to investigate the effects of various CVD factors, including smoking, diet, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), plasma glucose, and BMI among participants 27 years old or younger with a DM level of 180mm/l; hypertension \u2265 150mm/l; and a history of T2D. We propose that the results of the CKD study be used to guide interventions in the treatment of people with a history of T2D and their relatives.\nThis could lead to a number of new treatments and interventions, including education about personal health, self-management, lifestyle modification (including diet) and increasing physical activity, which could decrease T2D risk factors through increased awareness and the understanding that lifestyle factors can independently induce changes in the risk of CVD. Additional clinical outcomes research should include data on the cardiovascular effects of this study.\nThe study's main outcomes are: a) those who have or develop T2D and CVD or a close relative with a history of T2D or CVD; b) those of higher, younger, and lower BMI for both age and sex groups; and c) those who exhibit one or more CVD, or those with one or more CVD risk factors, on the CKD questionnaire, such as: smoking.\nWhat is the scope of this project?\nThe goal of the study\u2019s research is to assess the role of a particular CVD, diabetes type 2 on the development of diabetes and CVD, respectively, and examine whether the association is due to direct relationship, such as having diabetes, or indirectly, such as sedentary behaviour and diet, with the development of CVD.\nThe study will first identify individuals with T1DM, and those with CED (and subsequently HTN, diabetes and CVD), and examine how lifestyle factors, such as diet modification, exercise, physical activity, smoking, and diet, might lead to changes in CVD, diabetes or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. To ensure that the results are representative of the general population of the UK and that the study is a valuable tool for healthcare providers and their patients, the authors will have access to a sample of the UK population of type 2 diabetes patients, who are 27 years old or younger.\nThis would allow us to:\n- Identify and understand individuals from the UK who have the potential to develop type 2 diabetes and CVD.\n- Gain useful information for research and clinical trials, in particular to identify interventions that could be designed to achieve these outcomes.\n- Facilitate research and develop an initial programme of research that could be adapted or improved to meet particular needs of the UK population.\nWhen has the project been done?\nIn 2019, the data from this study will help to identify individuals who are at high risk of developing T1DM, and determine the factors associated with T1DM, CVD, and T2DM. These individuals could act as a resource for T1DM treatments, and also for intervention strategies in the UK.\nTo read more, please see:\nIn a study published in journal of Diabetes on 27 May 2019, a 73-year-old Korean male was diagnosed with", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\nThe goal of all these recommendations is to help people prevent cardiovascular disease.\nThe advice by NICE comes at a time of heightened public health attention on global tobacco control\u2014some 3 million cases of secondhand smoke exposure from tobacco products, plus 100,000,000 registered smoker deaths per year.\nIt's an unprecedented challenge, especially in the UK where the number of deaths from cancer\u2014due primarily to smoking\u2014is now 14 times the combined average for the developed world.\nWhat is happening in the UK?\nThe global number of smokers is rising. Worldwide, tobacco industry profits have increased in recent years and new tobacco products reach the market.\nBut the biggest threats to people's health are new ones.\nThe current smoking guidelines do not address the impact of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, or stroke, nor does they address the economic burden these diseases cause.\nThe Global Economic Impact of Tobacco, a report by IES, a UK think tank, estimated that tobacco control policies can save the UK economy more than \u00a37 billion by 2030. The report also estimated that smoking-related deaths are predicted to increase 29% in 2025.\nThe UK is now home to more than 721,000 smokers in the UK. However, those numbers will nearly double in 2027\u2014which represents an over-reporting of the true number of smokers.\nThe majority of these smokers will be young adults or people with chronic conditions who smoke for reasons beyond personal knowledge or experience:\n- In the first three years after their first cigarette\u2014before the first effects of the nicotine itself have worn off or the withdrawal symptoms, and they experience the first day smoking again\u2014most will start smoking again.\n- Within about four years after their first cigarette, they will smoke 10 times more cigarettes in a year compared to a control group.\n- And within six years they will also be smokers (47% vs 50%) or have first-degree relatives who are smokers (58% vs. 26%).\nThe risk of becoming a second-hand smoker in the UK is also rising over time.\nIt follows that the UK's population would likely bear a greater, if not identical, burden of tobacco disease, which is one of the main economic burden of smoking.\nIf it were a country that put a whole in one place, it would be a country that would be 32 times the amount of people who die from cancer, high blood pressure and heart disease.\nHow does tobacco get to this UK-like population?\nSmoke is spread across the UK by fires, roads, and highways.\nThe most widely used form is cigarettes, which account for 41% of British smoking. Second-hand smoke from matches and candles affects the same proportion of people who smoke.\nMethamphetamine is also a major contributing factor to tobacco addiction and its global uptake: 475,000 people use a methamphetamin device (e.g. meth-i) in the UK.\nAnd, as more people use these devices, smoking becomes more and more widely accepted.\nBut the risks of using these devices far outweigh the benefits:\n- Methamphetamin users are almost twice as likely to die of a smoking related emergency as methphetamine users.\n- Methamphetamine also acts as a stimulant, encouraging people to smoke faster and further.\n- Methamphetamine is banned in China, Vietnam, and Afghanistan. It is used in these countries in 35 different ways, such as in powder powders.\n- Methamphetamin users have about 13 times the risk of developing heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and chronic lung disease as the non-methamphetamin users.\nWe also know that people who have first-hand exposure to secondhand smoke are also at greater risk of tobacco-related disease.\nThe effects of these exposures are cumulative: if someone is exposed to 2.5 cigarettes a day for a month, the cumulative probability of developing some specific disease increases to between 5.5 and 10.5%.\nAnd if someone is exposed to twice as many cigarettes per day, that probability increases to more than 14.\nWho will become a smoker first?\nSmoking-related diseases and deaths are disproportionately higher in younger people. That means younger people are increasingly susceptible to the side-effects of nicotine.\nSmokers", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be? Based on the NICE guidelines for people with a BMI of 30 or more, here are the NICE CVD prevention recommendations for people with a BMI of 30, 11 or 13 kg/m\u00b2 (see appendix for table 1): The most important thing for the BMI is to get a good lifestyle and diet to prevent and lower weight-related comorbidities, which includes smoking, weight loss, diet, physical activity, and stress. It also requires adherence to an at-home lifestyle routine, which includes consistent exercise and healthy eating habits. It is important to get blood pressure and cholesterol checked regularly, and to take vitamins and supplements containing iron and calcium.\n|Binge eating||24 percent|\n|Binge drinking and binge drug use||210 percent|\n|Family history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or hypertension||18 percent|\n|Total cholesterol >40||44 percent|\nThere is much more to understand about what makes people\u2019s blood pressure, cholesterol, and other health indicators different in people with or without diabetes.\nIn the end, both BMI and diabetes are well-established risk factors for CVD in North America and the world, and the current guidelines are based on that. If more people are able to get their BMI and blood pressure down to a level of 18.5 to 24.9, risk of other conditions, such as hypertension, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and cardiovascular disease will also decrease; it will only take a few years of lifelong adherence to lifestyle changes that include reducing blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes. There also need to be a combination of preventative and therapeutic interventions in addition to lifestyle change.\n10.5 \u2013 Binge drinking, binge drug use, and high cholesterol\nThese are the main risk factors for high cholesterol in people with diabetes:\nAlcohol consumption is associated with higher than average levels of total cholesterol, totalHDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol.\nCholesterol levels are the main risk factor for heart and vascular disease in people with diabetes.\nIf people with diabetes can\u2019t control their cholesterol level, high triglycerides and inflammation will further increase risk of heart disease.\nThere need to be efforts to promote public and health insurance coverage to help people manage their health.\n10.6 \u2013 Diabetic patients at lower risk for cardiovascular disease\nIn adults, people with diabetes have higher than average risk of cardiovascular disease (1.6%).\nThere are many reasons, for example, that people with diabetes have a higher risk for CAD, such as:\n- Poor lifestyle habits that include smoking, high-fat and energy, and unhealthy diets of low-nutrient foods.\n- Age is the main risk factor for many diseases in people with diabetes, and these factors can easily be altered through intervention programs, as well as improved lifestyle habits.\n- Being overweight or obese will increase the risk of heart disease.\n- Metabolic disturbances, such as hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver can further increase the risk of heart disease.\nPatients and health care professionals can raise awareness about obesity by:\n- Discussing the need to change eating and exercise habits in people with diabetes.\n- Using educational tools that encourage eating healthy and exercise to lower the risk of heart disease, including:\n- Using a risk calculator to identify risk factors based on information from health professionals and families.\n- Giving educational courses to people with diabetes on healthy eating, behavior change programs, and how to maintain healthy weight.\n- Providing access to clinical preventive services: diabetes treatment can help reduce your risk for heart disease, especially if your diet and lifestyle choices have been changed. In addition, the best way to maintain your weight is by losing or keeping weight.\n- Use health information online from health care providers to help your doctor understand your current health status.\n- Use available information technology online as follows:\n- Ask your doctor if there are online resources to use to help yourself manage your body weight, such as diet and exercise classes from your doctor.\n- Ask your doctor to check and modify the diet and exercise to maintain your weight and to lower your risk from heart diseases.\n- Use a special website to help you manage your health, such as a mobile app called ControlYourDiabetes.\nDiabetic patients also need support to help them achieve their treatment goal: controlling their weight, treating high blood pressure, and controlling blood cholesterol level can help a lot of people with diabetes.\n|Gastroenterology and Hepatology||10", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\n(a) No\n(b) CKI 5-10 mmmol/L\n(c) Normal\n(d) LDL cholesterol\n(c) Low-Density Cholesterol\nThe patient has an A1C of 6.7%.

The best way to manage risks is through lifestyle changes, especially changes to diet and physical activity.\nThe National Prevention and Control of Heart Diseases, 3rd edition (NPCHS 3rd ed.) is recognised as an essential work tool for healthcare professionals. As with NICE\u2019s recommendation for CVD risk reduction, the NPCHS3rd edition is considered the \u2018gold standard\u2019 in guidelines for heart disease. The NPCHS3rd edition does, however, provide for the inclusion of other guidelines and recommendations, such as the Heart and Stroke 2025 guidelines, which are available at www.nhsaonline.org.

The patient should also be given an opportunity to voice any concerns or questions.\nWhat are examples of recommendations for CVD risk reduction?\nFor the guidelines, the patient is asked to review the NICE\u2019s CV guideline for adults with CVD. This guideline is used to determine if a patient in need of a CVD risk reduction protocol is eligible for treatment.\nIt is not just the patient who is under treatment but also their family members may be given advice on how to approach the patient. The family may also receive an overview on health literacy skills or other strategies such as self-monitoring when choosing a treatment plan for CVD.\nIn addition, other recommendations may include: (i) patients with heart defects who are at high risk of cardiac death due to the complications of coronary artery disease, including chest pain, stroke or sudden death; (ii) patients whose heart disease cannot be managed successfully due to medical contraindications such as low cardiac output; (iii) patients with congestive heart failure whose CVD treatment is contraindicated including end-stage heart failure, particularly if there is reduced ability to effectively control the disease but the patients are still able", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?

The guidelines aim to make people in their 20s (men for age 40-60, women for age 50-64) who are at high risk of CVD have access to tools and resources based on these recommendations.\nFor NICE, CVD is an umbrella term for a range of conditions that affect the heart, blood vessels, blood pressures and platelets, blood fats or sugars. It involves high cholesterol, heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blood (intravascular), diabetes, coronary artery disease and more, all these are conditions that require careful monitoring as well as prevention. Having any of these or other conditions combined means at risk for CVD.\nIf you\u2019re at risk for CVD, have been tested for a known genetic cause, or have a family history of CVD, NICE recommends having a cardiovascular risk score (CRS) test. These tests look at how likely you are to develop heart disease and stroke. For example, a factor analysis, looking at the risk factors of the 10 most commonly found SNPs, might give a genetic link to coronary artery disease.\nNICE says a cardiovascular risk score from a simple blood pressure measurement is only justifiable because 5 to 10 heart attacks can happen in just 1 year\u2019s time, after which one may become dependent on non-pharmacological treatment to avoid strokes or heart failure. A cardiovascular risk score can also be used to find a link between the genetic cause of specific diseases or genetic variants in family members with known at-risk conditions. For example, a genetic variant that increases the risk of heart attack could be linked to a person\u2019s at-risk genetic variation.\nFor certain patients with no family history of CVD, it is not only important to screen but could also be done without any involvement of a hospital. You can get your free NHS Framingham Cardiology QoS Score assessment right now to find out if you are at risk or have a known variant that increases risk and could be tested for in the next few days \u2013 they\u2019ll use the information to provide you with some resources too \u2013\nThere is also the option of using the NHS A-Z\u2019s and A-Z card at this time to be provided free of charge, and you could get involved the NHS Heart & Stroke Foundation 81-007 to find out more about the service.\nSo if you have ever been diagnosed as at-risk for CVD then please visit the NHS Heart and Stroke Foundation website and they have free resources which can be accessed by anyone at any time and will ensure that you get all the information you need to make the most of your CVD risk score \u2013 but if not then you should discuss with your GP.\nIf you have an ongoing cardiovascular problem and need to come for extra monitoring as well as a cardiovascular risk score, check out our Cardiology Cardiology Test Now.", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\nWhat is the consensus-based method for identifying those with a heightened risk of CVD in the UK?\nIf you don't like this item, why not download it for free?\nThank you for your visit, and I hope it helped.

It may seem like an all or nothing approach (all or nothing) to take for 4 hours when your cholesterol is stable, and all 500 mg statins can lower your cholesterol levels. However, that is not the case. I would go below the 40 mg statin for those without a history of CVD.\n- What are their recommendations?\nWe will talk about your treatment status, lifestyle factors (what you take to help prevent or lower your cholesterol levels), and the benefits and risks of lifestyle counseling. If your cholesterol level is out of the \u201cnormal\u201d range (100-139 mg per deciliter), the physician can suggest what could be done to alter that and also discuss which cholesterol-lowering drugs are more effective. On the other hand, if your cholesterol is in the \u201chigh\u201d range (over 180 mg/dL, the patient would need to take 25-30 mg of cholesterol drug every other day), the physician can also suggest what could be done to alter that and also discuss which drug would be best for her. That patient will probably have a specific dose, dosage schedule and frequency plan that they will modify. Your doctor will also discuss with you, either in the conversation and/or during this office visit, what lifestyle change should be made that will lower your cholesterol level, or what you should do right now if you are experiencing low cholesterol levels and want to learn about it at the next office visit.\nIn our conversation, if your cholesterol is high and you are on statin drug, my answer would be to talk to Dr. Teng to learn more if you want to change your medication. If your heart cholesterol test is negative or you are on a different class medication, I would encourage you to change one of your medications to one that you are following instead of increasing your risk of developing another serious heart condition, you can talk to Dr. Teng to determine what action to take because your cholesterol levels are not in the \u201chigh\u201d range.\nWhat would the physician recommend?\nIf your cholesterol level is in the higher range compared with your lifestyle?\nIf your cholesterol level is too high to see a different medication or a different lifestyle change plan, your physician might recommend that you do something to prevent a future stroke or heart attack.\nWhen should the physician start talking to you about preventive measures and lifestyle changes associated with CVD?\nWhat are some things that could be done to reverse CVD, such as: low-D-L concentrations or an LDL-cholesterol reduction test?\n- What can the healthcare provider and you do to do to protect you from another stroke or heart attack (or any other health disease)?\n1 of 4: Lifestyle Changes\nOur doctors work to keep your blood pressure, cholesterol, blood vessel health, and blood sugar levels in optimum ranges.

Smoking Cessation Treatment\nStarted with stopping smoking one year ago, it was still very hard, it took eight months for someone to stop smoking 70%. The 70% of people who smoke quit within 1 to 2 years, and 10% of people quit within 3 years. So, there are likely to be people who cannot quit for 12 years, and if the doctor is going to provide support then, then he will also need a lot of support.\nTherefore, you have to change the treatment methods, and if you want to be the first step, then you should talk to your doctor and see what the doctor thinks and then change it to fit your lifestyle.\n2. Avoid Unhealthy Lifestyle\nSmoking is a very unhealthy lifestyle. Therefore when quitting from smoking, the first thing is to see what is unhealthy lifestyle? In terms of health, health is a balance between the three nutrients: protein, carbohydrates, fat. So the diet should be balanced, and in addition to that, the alcohol should be less than 14 units per week, and in order to prevent smoking, the daily nicotine intake is not more than 250 mg.\nBut if there is more than 150 units per day, then you should reduce it and quit smoking.\n3. Increase Healthy Diet\nAnother key factor to keep your blood pressure down is to reduce your daily consumption of healthy fats and cholesterol. For example, you should eat fish fish more than less than 0.5 grams or fish. And this is also the number one factor to prevent obesity.\nYou have to prevent obesity in order to increase good cholesterol and blood pressure, and a lot of healthy fats are in fish, so they are also helpful to prevent atherosclerosis.\nSo, they should not be eaten too much and not necessarily in your diet.\n4. Regular Health Checkup\nIt is also very important to check blood pressure very regularly. If the health checkup is not done often, you may have other symptoms, so it is very important to see the doctor about this. The main reason is that you may have heart and lung disease. Therefore, the main recommendation of the doctor will be to monitor your health, and if you find it out that you have some heart or lung disease, then the doctor will also suggest treatment for you for you, so you can control your health.\nWith the help of the health checkup and prevention, people have more chance to quit smoking.", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?\n- In a 29-year retrospective cohort study, if patients had a CVD risk score of 0, 0.9 or 1, respectively, how many years should they be thought of as having CVD risk? Assume baseline risk of 2.3% for every additional year of follow-up, and that risk was proportional to age.\n- The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association publish new consensus statement recommendations for CVD risk in clinical practice.

Does the 14-year survival rate suggest the 15-year survival rate is an overestimate of survival?\n- When considering the 2019 Australian Adult Fitness Index and the 2020 Australian Healthy and Active Living Survey, what percentage of the population has some degree of cardiovascular disease?\n- Which of the following is NOT a key health indicator for reducing the risk of CVD?", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?\nThe guidelines that I am going to share with you are the two NHS guidelines and the other guideline from the AHA. The guidelines are: \"Healthy person-oriented intervention\". The interventions are described below:\n\u2022 Cardiovascular Disease prevention & control: What are the actions that you can take to prevent, reduce, or control your risk of CVD.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular disease: The prevention of CVD includes:\n1. Reducing your risk factors: Smoking, high cholesterol, & eating foods which are high in dietary cholesterol.\n2.

You have 15 minutes. Use the table provided to calculate your risk reduction for each condition:\n- If John's BMI values were a 0 to 18.5, there would be no need for a plan to manage his risk\n- If a family history of CAD was present, and a BMI was 30 to 34, and a risk to develop a cardiovascular condition was 18 to 59\n- For a history of diabetes, the risk would be 29 and up per 1000 person years.\n7. If John had a family history of CAD, what is his risk to develop a cardiovascular condition?\n- If John had a family history of CAD, his risk to develop a cardiovascular condition is 5.3 per million person years\n- If John had a family history of CAD, his risk to develop a cardiovascular condition is 51 percent\n- If John had a family history of CAD, his risk to develop a cardiovascular condition is 23 percent\n- If John had a family history of CAD, his risk will be 34 percent\nWhen using the BMI table, it is advisable to work backwards to use a ratio of 1.0 to 6.7 mmol/L. This means that 10 percent of the age group is above the normal BMI range, or the ideal BMI range for adults. 23 to be 18, the level under which most health problems can occur. To attain this BMI level, adults over 40 are expected to need 9.8 BMI meals per week for weight maintenance; for those aged 50-59 are expected to need at least 17.6 daily BMI meals; in men, 16.6 daily meals; for women, 15.4 daily meals.\nOnce a person is able to maintain a healthy weight, other lifestyle changes will then occur. For example, to obtain optimal results, you will need to start by improving your diet. You need to make sure you cut back on sugars from the daily menu, and then you will need to change your exercise routine so you stay active. You also require to change your social networking habits and your activity level in terms of time and places you visit.\nCardiovascular disease and a healthy lifestyle, but the right diet\nThe diet that is beneficial for individuals with cardiovascular disease, the benefits of which can continue for many years into your later years, is:\n- A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meat, poultry, fish, legumes, and nuts\n- A diet high in fruit and vegetables\n- Aiming for 5 portions of vegetables and fruit (250 to 350 grams per day or a small window of time)\n- Aim for a minimum of five servings of grains, including breads, cereals and pasta\n- A minimum of three portions of fish and/or salmon\n- Aiming for three portions of pulses (e.g. green vegetables, peas and beans)\n- Aiming for three portions of dairy products\n- Aiming for two portions of eggs\n- Aiming for a minimum of two portions of dairy products, three portions of pulses (e.g. vegetables, beans and peas), lean meat, and poultry\n- Aiming for three portions of protein-rich foods (e.g. fish and seafood, lean meats, dairy, eggs, nuts and seeds), legumes and pulses\n- Aiming for no more than one serving of a starch-containing food per day, a minimum of three portions of vegetable and fruit\n- Aiming for no more than two portions of milk\n- Aiming for no more than two portions of dairy products\n- Aiming for no more than one portion of fat-containing foods per day, a minimum of three portions of vegetable and fruit\n- Aiming for no more than one portion of high-fibre dairy products\nIf you are not able to eat from the vegetables list, you can aim to increase your fruit and vegetables intake. A diet that is low in salt, and that is rich in fruit and vegetables will therefore be more beneficial.\nIt may seem counter intuitive, but that your heart is healthy or that you are on a diabetes prevention plan for your health risk, is a pretty big deal!

In general, consuming a healthy diet may reduce total and/or LDL-C and systolic blood pressure and improve blood lipids, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. It is very possible that reducing smoking also can reduce CVD.\nThere is good evidence to suggest that a combination of nutritional and lifestyle changes (eating less unhealthy, exercising) can reduce the risk of CVD. The Cochrane Library identified no controlled trials at date that examined dietary supplements and CVD, but this should change.\nSmoking cessation generally does not change the risk of CVD. However, it may be a good strategy, when patients have difficulties stopping smoking.

The Cochrane Library identified no controlled trials at date that examined dietary supplements and CVD. However, one review in 2009 found, in a large population cohort study, that diet and supplements are very low in cardiovascular disease risk and protective. It looked at a series of studies of participants (\nA number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), based on either dietary support or supplements, have demonstrated that such interventions might help reduce CVD risk. An RCT of a dietary treatment designed to reduce smoking had similar outcomes to a placebo, with an average reduction of less than 14% in risk of all-cause mortality.\nThe randomised trial of the supplement for prevention of cancer was a low-intensity study, for which a total of 14,000 people with cancer were randomly allocated into a group receiving regular supplementation (15 mg of fish oil, 5 mg of calcium carbonate, 3 mg of vitamin D, and vitamin E) and a control group receiving usual care. Participants at the highest supplementation dose were less likely to develop a specific type of cancer. Despite this finding, there was still no difference in the risk of cancer from placebo or from conventional cancer treatment in this trial.\nA pilot study reported at 2006 in Taiwan indicated that a fish oil treatment was effective in lowering the risk of lung cancer by about 50%, and a fish oil supplement was effective in lowering the risk of some types of skin cancer by 20%. Other RCTs report similar results in lung cancer, kidney cancer and breast cancer.\nThis Cochrane Summary, published in 2010 on the basis of a review of 18 RCTs identified in 2009 about a range of healthy lifestyles and lifestyle changes, provides some of the guidance that should guide our practice. It recognises that there is some evidence to suggest there isn\u2019t enough clinical evidence to support the use of dietary supplements in improving outcomes in particular at low risk of CVD, but notes that only the lowest levels of supplementation are beneficial and that there is little evidence that supplements with high levels of micronutrients are superior to a supplement containing the same dose. Supplements may be a better approach than dietary intervention.\nWe need to know more about the impact of diet (what we eat) and lifestyle changes on CVD risk. For example, what should be the risk ratio between heart attacks and heart disease and how do we measure these numbers?

Why?\nPlease complete this discussion before watching the video:\nHow can you support yourself during these times?\nPlease complete this discussion after watching the video:", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?\nAns: In John's case, the National Heart, Lung Institute recommends a smoking-cessation program (Smoking is the leading cause of chronic disease in the United States and the most common cause of death worldwide) and the same type of dietary regimen in which he will include dietary supplements, especially omega-3 fatty acids (the heart-healthy good fat that may decrease blood pressure).\nIf John meets all the 90-day coronary risk goals for a patient of 74.5kg, the 100-day risk reduction goal is to achieve 45% of these goals without any additional supplementation. In this case, with John having a BMI of 42, the 90-day cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio is predicted to reduce by 15% (110/70 = 4.2). If John has a total cholesterol below 2.2 mmol/L, the 100-day cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio is predicted to decrease by 27% (235/259 = 2.76).\nThis means that, given these goals, the 50 kg reduction goal is feasible with John. A 100-day exercise program of 30 minutes or more per day, 17 days a week is acceptable for John. The 150-day exercise program is suitable if he starts to lose weight and does not have a history of hypertension. This would be an exercise program aimed at 30\u201340 minutes daily. If he does not have the healthy weight, this 50-day exercise program is not acceptable. A 20% reduction in body weight reduction is assumed for this patient.\nFor John, a 200-kilogram reduction is adequate to reach the 100- and 150-day goals. According to the guidelines for CVD risk management based on blood pressure, the 50- and 100-day targets are reasonable if John has a BMI no more than 30 at the time of the assessment, a normal blood pressure, no known diabetes, is smoking free, he has no history of CVD, and has no family history of CVD. If John had a BMI of 50, the 100-day intake is 200\u2013400 mL of coffee per day, and the 150-day intake is 200\u2013400 mL of coffee/day. The 50 kg reduction goal is 30 g of olive oil per day, and the 100-day goal is 20 g olive oil/day (200\u2013400 mL = 200\u2013400 mL).\nIf John does not have a history of CVD, the 50 kg reduction goal is 30 g of olive oil per day, and the 100-day goal is 20 g of olive oil/day. These 2 approaches are acceptable if John is weight-conscious and a healthy weight. Of course, it is necessary to remember that exercise can be a very low-impact and low-cost approach to lose weight and keep it off.\nWhen John is at his current weight, his exercise program is adequate. The 50 kg goal is 240\u2013360 mL/day of water/liquids (150\u2013300 mL) and should be based around the food program. He also consumes meals that include nuts, seeds, 5\u20136 of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and water. The 50 kg reduction goal is 240 mL water/liquids (150\u2013300 mL) per day, and the 100-day goal is 800 mL/day of low-fat milk (125\u2013150 mL = 600\u2013800 mL).\nAlthough John's weight is at a more manageable level, a combination of water and low-carbohydrate carbohydrates is necessary to maintain or improve his energy levels, blood pressure, and cardiovascular fitness without causing a nutritional crisis. It is important to have a healthy range of food intake. A typical diet should provide about 1,200 mL of water/liquids for John (150\u2013300 mL = 1,800\u20132,400 mL [2,100", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?\n- NICE recommends that both the first-ever treatment for all-cause mortality or stroke in the absence of cardiovascular risk in people with a higher income and a normal health-related quality of life (HRQoL)\n- Current guidelines recognise the need to intervene in those at a high risk of developing CVD in society through lifestyle modifiable risk factors. These include tobacco harm reduction, high intake of unsaturated fatty acids, physical inactivity, obesity, and poor diet. Intervention programs can include increased fruit and vegetable intake, limiting sugar intakes to less than five sugar equivalents each day, and physical inactivity reduction to 30 to 35 min/day. The following guidelines are not based on the latest NICE guidelines:\n- This guideline is only a summary of recommendations provided by NICE, based on a range of evidence in different domains of health and CVD.

It is also important to try to avoid smoking and having other risk factors for heart and vascular diseases such as diabetes and hypertension.\nFor more information: http://www.canadaconference.ca/content/23/CVD/smoking_interventions.pdf\nAbout the author: Brian R.

They looked at information on the 379,707 people who had been tested for a variety of health conditions including diabetes. These people were matched with a random number drawn from the healthy group, so the results matched the healthy group.\nFindings suggested that people with long-standing cardiovascular disease were more likely to have low HDL cholesterol levels, higher blood pressure, or no symptoms of CVD. People with diabetes were much less likely than those with healthy conditions to have a high blood pressure and have had a heart attack or stroke.\n\"Over the next five or so years, people who would be eligible for this study now will have some sort of risk factor that they cannot manage to control,\" says Jepsen. \"These factors include high cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, obesity, or both.\"\nA person's risk of heart attack and stroke is assessed yearly.

The NICE guideline is the latest version of the guidance and should remain current. It focuses on how lifestyle and lifestyle factors can increase CVD risk, including eating more healthy and lower in saturated fats, sugar, salt, and alcohol and physical activity level.\nIt includes guidelines to reduce the use of tobacco, to increase physical activity, and to prevent obesity \u2013 the most significant risk factor for CVD.\nWhat is the main cause of heart disease?\nCoronary heart disease (CHD) causes about 1 in every 15 deaths in the UK each year. In the EU, 30,300 deaths per year (from CHD) are caused by lifestyle causes alone.\nWhat is a high cholesterol problem?\nHigh cholesterol is the result of a lack of dietary and lifestyle factors that affect lipid metabolism. The most important factors that contribute to higher lipids in the blood are increased cholesterol levels, a high protein content of these in the diet, a fat poor diet, and smoking.\nWhat foods are high in saturated fat?\nFruits and vegetables, especially those high in Vitamin C, such as, oranges, grapefruits, strawberries, papaya, papaya and watermelons, can increase the intake of cholesterol intake.\nWhat are healthy fats?\nGood fats include: Avocade, olives, almonds, and olive oil.\n\u201cCarbs can be high in the form of simple and complex sugars which, when digested, release glucose and other blood sugar products into the bloodstream\u201d\nIt can be very important that people consume foods that are high in carbohydrates and low in fat because of the fact that carbohydrates, particularly in the form of sugar (glucose), and fats produce very little insulin.\nGlucose from food can be converted into glycogen by protein cells, in particular in the liver, the muscles, and the brain, and also in the adipose tissue.\nA very important factor to know is that the liver\u2019s glycogen is actually made up of four macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and vitamins) and one component (glycogen is actually glucose) \u2013 it contains very little protein, which is why it is mainly processed by the body.\nIt does not produce as much insulin as it should because its beta cells (cells in the pancreas responsible for producing insulin) are destroyed by chronic fasting and obesity.\nIf you want to buy protein as opposed to protein, your body needs protein for muscle growth and repair. If you want to eat protein, you should eat protein at least once a day, ideally three times a day.\nIt should be possible to convert protein into cholesterol, which can then be transferred to the liver to be used for the synthesis of fatty acids.", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?\n|Age||Life Expectancy* (yr)|\n|11 years||8.27 (6,120+)|\n|12 years||8.90 (6,500-) 9- 16 years||8.17 6.80 99 42.39|\n|13 years||8.70 (6,900+)|\n*Age at first screening\n**Fertility potential is determined in men between age 27 and 48. In the absence of a fertility test, 20 women or 18 men are considered to have been in a state of infertility due to age alone. A review of studies by 16414 women and 4233 men suggests that 18 \u2013 55 year olds have the highest risk.\n*Age of men 55-79\n**Fertility potential is determined by the age at the last period (breast) of the last fertile period, age of first conception (of 75-80 years), age of second (of 55-59 years) and age at second conception (3-8 years). Of the 7322 patients diagnosed with CVD with 20-65 year olds as the average age, the chance of stillbirth increased from 31% to 75%. There was no link between the number of stillborn babies in women with a history of CVD and any of the predictors for CVD. (CVD risk is decreased in women who give birth, as reported in the data on women in the first 9-12 months after the first natural conception), so women with a history of history of CVD appear to be at higher risk of developing CVD.\nWe are not able to provide direct information for these countries on any specific health issue. What we do know is that most CVDs occur in those older than 20 years. The most significant cardiovascular events of CVD over the last 15 years have been ischemic heart disease (which is the single leading cause of death worldwide), cerebrovascular disease, heart failure, and hypertension.\nFor women and men, the risk factors are high or high, but women have a more rapid rise in heart attack risk from age 50-79 than are men. The risk of CVD from other lifestyle habits, such as smoking (increasing the risk from 14% to 27%), elevated alcohol intake (increased risk from 27% to 55%), and obesity (increased risk from 55% to 75%), has not been demonstrated. For men, the evidence is mixed. After age 65, the chance of suffering a stroke (22%) due to obesity is also increased. The risk of non-fatal heart failure from smoking cessation increases with age. An association between CVD and alcohol has not been shown in women in most parts of the world.\nMany CVDs are associated with a history of CVD, whereas others are not. A large Australian population study by Gomes and colleagues found that among males with a history of CVD, 9.4% had a history of CVD in the past 15 years, compared with 1.1% of the total population of individuals without CVD. In other words, of the total population of 9.4% of men, 1.1% of the males are known never to have a history of CVD. Among women, however, the chance of having had a first heart attack before age 45, for the first 35 years of life or in the past 15 years of life, is not significantly increased with age.\nIn conclusion, as a general rule, women are at greater risk of having a heart attack as compared to men at any age except menopause.\nTo ensure that women of reproductive age are aware of the available CVD services available, or are informed about what they could do to benefit from the available resources to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.\nThe CVD Risk Guidelines\nCVD has been the topic of much debate within medicine, as the reasons for which specific CVDs of women and men should receive treatment for their heart problems. The Canadian Task Force on Cardiometabolic Risk Factors, launched by former Minister of Health Bill C-240 in 1999, stated that women have a greater susceptibility to cardiovascular disease than do men.
