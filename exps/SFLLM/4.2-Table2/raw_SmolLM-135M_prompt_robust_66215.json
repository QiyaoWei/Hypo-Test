He has a\n# personal spending account of $3000. We define a 'good' spending money as $\n# $5000 per day for five days (for example, if we're assuming we can work 50\n# days), plus $6000 at the end of the period, and $3000 at the end of our second\n# working day. We could use this number (of $5000 to start the expenditure) and\n# want to ensure the spending does not exceed our monthly limit. We can use a\n# spending constraint.\n\n#  For this example, let's assume it's $500 per person day, and the limit we want to\n# apply is $6000 (or $3000) per pay period.\n\n# The total budget of $3000 to set up is:\n# (3000 * $5000) / ($6000) = $30\n\n#  This is what a spending constraint is. It limits us to $30 per pay period.\n#  If we don't work 500 days (5:00pm to 6:00pm), we're out of $6000.\n\n# We're allowed to only work one day per month, and to work 50% of the\n# pay period.\n\n#  How can we define a spending constraint (and the number of people per\n# payment period)? This is:\n# (20 * 6000) / (3 + 1) = 3\n# 3 is a variable cost. We're allowed to work 3 days, and spend $1980 per pay period\n# (or $3000 max).\n\n#  Now, the cost of this spending constraint is $(3 * 6000) / 6000 = 3620.25.\n\n# So, for a worker account or other expense such as a job pay-off, a spending constraint\n# (as far as I know) enforces the working rule (or no work rule).\n\n#  (If we don't work 500 days, we can't work 50% or less of 50 days, so we'll need to make sure we work\n# no less than 40 days for maximum.\n\n#  If we want to work 55 people per pay period, we'll need to find a spending\n# constraint of 4 for each person. So for example, if we're working 50 days per\n# pay period, we'd need to find a spending constraint for someone whose work time\n# ends at 55, or at least at 80 days (like a 40 day work week).\n\n# (If there is too much time off, we will have to do other things.)\n\n#  I want to make sure that the spending constraint is correct for both the\n# working and non-working days. I'm assuming it's a 50% work rule:\n# 20 * 12000 / 50 % = 3620\n\n#  In fact, it's a work rule. There's a 50% limit, and 55 days is the\n# working day, so work rules are true.

You may have some additional cardiovascular screening to make sure you are doing well and for you and your family to plan the best possible outcome. These include:\nA variety of tests are available to your GP to monitor your heart. The majority of these tests will require an overnight stay, which is common for most people if they are admitted to hospital: They can help to identify areas where treatment will be needed to improve a patient's or their doctor's outlook.

The Heart and Stroke Foundation was set up by the UK Government in 2003 and is funded by NHS Trusts. The foundations aim to help in all areas which affect the heart, including patients, health professionals, and public.\nAt a time when there are more and more heart attacks in the United States and other countries, it is crucial that you understand the symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of heart disease. Understanding the symptoms of heart disease means you can recognise which symptoms may mean you have a heart disease and can be treated if this is happening in your heart disease.\nSymptoms of heart disease can include but are not limited to feeling the beat of your heart. You may feel the sensation of the heartbeat, have problems with your heart beating normally when you are sleeping, feel your heart beating loudly or more deeply and feel out of breath. It can also feel as though the heart isn't working properly.\nIn this video, we explain the difference between a heart attack and heart failure. We explain the reasons why we can feel the heartbeat differently and how these different symptoms show up.\nYou may still have any symptoms of heart disease if your doctors haven't diagnosed or diagnosed the problem but still have the problem is diagnosed. This is because it's important to be aware of the signs of heart disease and to be able to identify the symptoms. Here's our full guide for explaining the common warning signs and symptoms of heart disease.\nHeart disease is the number one cause of death in the UK. People can make the correct choice for their heart and lifestyle when trying to avoid heart disease and heart attacks. There are many signs of cardiovascular disease, so it's important to learn how to recognise the signs and be aware of the signs and symptoms of heart disease. In this video we show you how to recognise the signs of heart disease and give you advice on how to keep healthy and preventing heart disease and heart attacks.\nThere are lots of signs that suggest that someone may have CVD. Most of these signs will be physical (things we do, such as breathing, heart rate, height, strength and activity level, and more), so it's important to look out for these signs in someone who has symptoms. Many of these signs will also be related to things like diabetes, smoking and high blood pressure. We will briefly discuss these and give you the next section on these physical signs of CVD, so check back here often.\nHeart disease and stroke are two conditions that can be prevented, although heart disease and strokes are similar. The disease-one is when something is damaged to your heart and the other is when it is damaged to the heart. While heart disease is often caused by unhealthy or smoking behaviour, strokes are caused by hard work and stress.\nFor help, call 000 or go to your local NHS Emergency Department, please complete the NHS Heart and Stroke Foundation's Call the Doctor Online Survey.

With some variables this can be, 1kg, 1kg = 100 grams.\nWhen you multiply the number per cent by the person's weight, it's calculated in a formula called percent change which has the weight in terms of percent per unit.\n100 x.7 = 50\n50 / 2\n5\n\nThis gives you 5 percent.\n\n5 / 20\n5 / 44\n5 / 75\n\nTherefore your total weight is 55 kg.\n\nSo your \"reasonable weight\" for this person is 20.\n\n55 kgs.\n\nIf you are 50 pounds weight, and you want to lose 1 kg, you should aim to lose between 35 Kg to 40 Kg. \nSo if you want to lose 1kg you should aim for 35 Kg, 35 Kg = 786.5 kgs. \nThis equates to 14.0818 kilograms/day.\nIf you are 50 pounds weight you should aim to lose between 5 kg to 6 kg. \nSo if you want to lose 1kg you should aim for 5 kg, 5 kg = 10 Kg. \nThis equates to 14.0818 kilograms/day.\nNow you can now calculate my BMI which is 18.\n\nAs for my total caloric intake, I need to be 100% aware that I am a very calorie-conscious person. I'm 42. \n\nI'd need 3,500 Kcals for the rest if I wanted to have a healthy weight.\n\nThank You To All For your input on this problem and comment at your works\n\n### 12 days ago\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n\nLaid back", "John has these features: Age: 46, BMI: 31.8, Blood Pressure: 117/74 mmHg, \n    Total Cholesterol: 7.1 mmol/L, HDL Cholesterol: 1.9 mmol/L, \n    Smoking Status: never smoked, Diabetes: no diabetes, \n    Family History of CVD: yes, Ethnicity: White. Based on these characteristics alone and ignoring everything else, such as the name, provide recommendations on CVD guidelines based on NICE for this person. \n    Note: Please use the above 4-person methodology which was adapted by The Health Institute. \n\n    To answer the question, I chose this solution only for this individual as this person has several criteria that will be met. To get answers to this question, these other criteria have to be met: \n    1. BMI (Adult Norm): 22.5, Weight-for-height: 174.3, Length-for-height: 7 feet, 31 inches, Hypertension: yes, DKA: yes, Diabetes: yes, 4th degree MI: yes, DVT: yes, CVD: yes, AFB: yes, Heart disease, Angina: yes, Cardiovascular Disease, Heart disease & related risk factors: yes, CVD, Diabetes: yes.

Lifestyle Interventions are ineffective in reducing incident CVDs\n       AND     : >50% of people with CVD who are considered vulnerable, will show good response\n\n         \n      2. Lifestyle Interventions, as they are well known to be effective, is a self-inflicted, uncontrolled risk factor that can be attributed to:\n       a) socio-economic disparity: high poverty rates, low educational status, high unemployment, poor nutrition.\n       b) Lifestyle behaviours: smoking behaviour, lack of control over food choices, inactivity, unhealthy sedentary behaviour, unhealthy sedentary lifestyle, physical inactivity, sedentary lifestyle is linked to an altered cardio vascular activity during and after cardio metabolic stress. \n       c) Lifestyle behaviours, lack of behavioral science, lack of evidence.\n     \n    The goal is that a number of people will respond equally well to every intervention (either lifestyle or dietary). \n    \n     \n    \n    I would suggest to do an in-depth analysis on the data collected. I will only list a few general points about which you will see in my methodology. Also check the other papers/resources I use in this study.\n    \n    This study has a 4-1=18026 person-years of follow up.  I will calculate the cohort averages based on the population as a whole: \n    1. 18026 = 47, BMI: 30.8, Total Cholesterol: 116.3, Weight-for-height 66.1, Weight-for-height 87.4, Total-HDL 88.4, HDL-C 1.0, Total-HDL 1.2. 2. 18030 = 41, BMI: 24.0, Weight-for-height: 65.6, Weight-for-height: 0.2, Total cholesterol 7.0, Total-HDL+cholesterol 0.7, Total-LDL+cholesterol 0.4, Cholesterol: No, High Cholesterol or Normal Cholesterol, Heart disease, Atherosclerosis, Atherosclerosis, Atrial Fibrillation and Arterial Disease, Advanced Atherosclerosis. 3. 18035 = 41, BMI: 24.0, Weight-for-height 63.7, Weight-for-height 62.5. 4. 1", "John has these features: Age: 46, BMI: 31.8, Blood Pressure: 117/74 mmHg, \n    Total Cholesterol: 7.1 mmol/L, HDL Cholesterol: 1.9 mmol/L, \n    Smoking Status: never smoked, Diabetes: no diabetes, \n    Family History of CVD: yes, Ethnicity: White.

For instance, \"Family history of diabetes\" is recommended here.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to add that in terms of cardiology, not all diseases are treatable easily or are preventable. In some cases, the disease has certain genes that can lead to a certain disease, and you can manage these problems.\n\n3. Conclusion: This is an interesting question, as if people have heard the same about risk factors and health outcomes but did not understand each other, but if the two share common common factors, then they can be connected. This connection between two concepts, such as the fact that people with the same risk factors can have different outcomes, leads us to ask: \"Is there a common denominator?\" \n\n4. References: \n1.

Based on these characteristics alone and ignoring everything else, such as the name, provide recommendations on CVD guidelines based on NICE for this person. That is the WHO/European Society for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Diseases (as reported in the journal, BMJ) and the British Heart Foundation. Based on this, it suggests that you should undergo the following steps.\n\n\u2022 Take cholesterol and blood pressure tests twice yearly and every 3 years after that (which includes yearly).\n\u2022 If you have any risk of heart disease, particularly those with a major risk of heart disease or having had a heart attack, then you should do these after you and your partner don't smoke, which was already listed in the WHO/European Society for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Diseases.\n\u2022 If you do not smoke, then you should not continue smoking: this will prevent you from losing any heart risk as well as from the risk of complications such as developing heart failure and/or strokes.\n\u2022 If you have diabetes, then you should keep taking your medicines.\n\u2022 If you have high blood pressure, then your doctor should take action soon after to lower it. If you do not take your medicine, then you should go and take them regularly. That is to say: you have to take your medicine even if you are not feeling well. It will work better and you will be less likely to develop a heart condition; however, the doctor will prescribe you either a medicine, or it is not at home.\n\u2022 Get screened for hypertension at younger age when possible: people who are aged in the range of 20-30 are recommended for screening for high blood pressure at a young age. However, this is not done in all countries. However, for these people, screening at a younger age (from 14 to 18 years) at the same time in every blood pressure test is recommended. A person who already has high blood pressure, needs at least two blood tests per year but that could be longer.\n\nHere are some examples of questions that your doctor may ask:\n\n\u2022 Has this person had a heart attack in five years?\n\u2022 How does the person feel at home now?\n\u2022 Have this person seen a primary healthcare provider after coming to the hospital today?\n\u2022 Have any symptoms of a heart attack, strokes, or other cardiovascular conditions, such as angina or chest pains, since you had your last blood pressure test on your own? If so, how long have you had these symptoms?\n\u2022 Do you use the first line therapy for your problems: medication, exercise, or other alternative treatments that have benefits for your overall health and well-being? If yes, how do you deal with these symptoms?\n\u2022 How do you make a positive decision about your treatment options? Is there any risk involved? If yes, what is the best course of treatment?\n\nIf you are 20 or older: You need to go to a doctor for a second opinion from an expert in the field of heart health. Your doctor may recommend some non-invasive tests. For example: a scan to see your carotid artery and evaluate whether you can tolerate any medicines, which can affect the flow of oxygenated and unoxygenated blood coming from the lungs. If you have diabetes, then you need to be monitored daily.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo, you have just answered what I think what is in the text to be: heart disease risk factors, what is a WHO/European Organisation for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases is a common factor. Therefore, the conclusion is no.\n\nThis is why the WHO/European Union has recommended the following recommendations, which are not new:\n\n\u2022 You should do the following things:\n1. Stop smoking;\n2. Stop smoking and drinking:\n3. Stop taking medicines: there are now 700 medicines, including drugs for different ailments, but they are not good for you;\n4. Take at least two times a day exercise;\n5. Eat a balanced diet, avoiding fried or fast food, salt, sweets, alcohol, and caffeine.\n6. Avoid stress, do not go out too much, make long walks, go to the gym, and take care of your health.\n7. You should exercise more; walk outside at least one hour a day; do it every day during the day; but take care of your health, and make sure that it does not cause your health problems that might happen, such as weight gain or osteoporosis; or go to the swimming pool and exercise, avoid standing for long periods of time, and drink plenty of", "John has these features: Age: 46, BMI: 31.8, Blood Pressure: 117/74 mmHg, \n    Total Cholesterol: 7.1 mmol/L, HDL Cholesterol: 1.9 mmol/L, \n    Smoking Status: never smoked, Diabetes: no diabetes, \n    Family History of CVD: yes, Ethnicity: White.

These people were recruited via the online portal http://www.nimh.nih.gov.\nHow did I get the results?\nThe people who were recruited by this study were selected by the following criteria:\nThey are healthy enough to answer a few basic questions and are healthy enough to take part in this study. The data will be recorded by phone or email.\nParticipants will work together in a team to read, discuss, and agree on a list of symptoms that might lead to a diagnosis of a cardiovascular condition and ask them what they want the doctor to do to make them feel well.\nAfter the first round they will be invited to participate in a second round of data collecting to collect other data such as age, ethnicity, gender, BMI, smoking, cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, and diabetes incidence.\nThe results of this study will contribute to the guidelines for patients on coronary heart disease by helping to better evaluate heart risk and improve health care.\nWho was the population?\nThe people in this study are older people between 50 and 54 years old.\nWho was the population?\nThe populations of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway were selected from this study population.\nWho was the population?\nAll of the older adults in this study were given an assessment by a primary care physician. There will be six tests administered with this assessment. The questions are based on the recommendations of the above-mentioned NICE guidelines for adult people with cardiovascular risk in relation to an assessment by the primary care physician, for the purposes of their care.\nFor each test, a person will be asked to answer several questions about himself or herself and his/her family. These information will be entered on a computer. If an answer is given, the person will be referred to a trained nurse to do a full cardiovascular risk assessment. The nurse will then complete another simple assessment about the patient by asking questions, for example, \"Are there other risk factors?\" The patient will be asked one question from that assessment before the nurse gives an overall description of the patient. The evaluation of the patients\u2019 symptoms based on this assessment is done using the NICE guidelines. Data will be recorded at the end of the assessment by the nurse (for example, with an email) and submitted by the nurse after taking an overall description of the patient.\nThe study of data will be conducted using a mobile phone network network. You can send surveys, emails, or other communication messages over this network. The same data from the first and second rounds will be sent back to the primary care physician.\nHow was this study selected?\nIn the selected regions the population of the regions was selected based on data collected in Denmark from 2004 - 2006, and in Sweden from 2008 to 2012. The population of the Sweden group was selected based on the results from an assessment of 750,000 people. The results provided by the Swedish government can be used to collect data on different types of subjects, and this study was the largest study on any cohort in Denmark and Sweden, as well as the largest study of its kind in Scandinavia.\nWhen was the study conducted?\nThe study started in April 2015. The primary care physician (CPG) will complete a complete assessment using the same questionnaire that was used by the NICE guidelines (see Chapter 1).

Start with an easy change and work up to bigger changes when you are able to. For example, begin with a walk, then add coffee or iced tea and slowly introduce more physical activity. At first, take a good long walk at least 30 minutes twice a week before moving on to exercise regularly. When you think you are ready to engage in much more physical activity, increase your daily physical activity by 50 minutes. Gradually introduce more intense physical activity to your daily life if you find it too difficult and start moving at home with family to increase the intensity of the activities by 50%, but start moving at home to decrease the intensity of these activities by 30%. In order to increase your exercise for the best possible results, aim for a goal of 30 X 100 minutes per week. It is possible that you won't be able to complete the recommended 30 X 100 minutes of the suggested number of physical activity for the week, but this is possible if you take the time to find a time to walk, to do some walking in the kitchen, or to play some music.\nUpvotes: 2 username_4: If you just haven't had your heart checked recently, or have been in recent years with diabetes or hypertension (or some of these other conditions), this can be challenging to keep track of. I just found this information to be helpful.\n\nA few things to keep in mind.\nFirst, it will take time, so be patient. In case a heart failure is still present, have a discussion with the Heart Association before trying to lose weight or change your diet. Having all the heart disease risk factors is not going to do much good in the long-term, because heart disease is a disease that doesn't have any real symptoms. This is why I always tell my patients to have a cholesterol screening (premature).\n\nSecond, if your heart, lungs and liver work properly, and your heart does have any problems, or if if the doctor is treating you effectively, you have no heart disease, then you are ok when you have no symptoms. In other words even if you smoke, have high blood pressure or have other chronic health issues, you don't have to get your heart examined if it's functioning at peak. Make sure you are not getting into any major problems. Your health will improve once your heart is healthy and functioning at peak.\n\nThird, if you need to lose a pound or two, then you are not doing so well.\n\nLastly, if you are overweight, your blood pressure must not be too high. Your blood pressure is determined by how much your blood vessels are dilated (the body is pumping blood). If one of your blood vessels is dilated, that is not good. If one of your legs is too big, then your heart would be too large, and not enough blood could be pumped. Your heart would be too big, and there would not be enough blood pressure to pump it, and it would be too slow to function, and it is not going to provide the oxygen the heart needs. These conditions aren't bad, and you do not need to get evaluated, if you are already having some issues with your heart and diabetes and hypertension, your doctor may be going after another bad issue, such as chronic bronchitis and asthma. It will also take time to get to this point, but in the meantime, you will be able to get back to a more normal, healthy, and well-functioning heart and lungs.\n\n[EDIT - sorry I may have made an error in spelling out some words. - Thanks for reading!]\nUpvotes: 1 username_5: As I hear it from the site:\n\n> \n> There are currently 393,000 patients with cardiovascular and cardiovascular disease (CV disease).

His wife has cardiovascular disease, but no known risk factors.\n- If NICE recommends the algorithm, what might be the next steps for John?\n- What would be the next steps for Dr. Li in setting the patient's goals for the guidelines?\nIn this scenario, NICE recommend a 30-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 50 kg/m2 and no known risk factors should be treated for an average-risk cholesterol 5 mmol/L. Following the screening, there is no known risk factor for any CVD events he is experiencing. NICE recommends the next step, the patient would need to start a new high-intensity exercise program. Once this is confirmed, and the patient is a 60-year-old Chinese male and a smoker (and other associated risk factors; such as hypertension and diabetes), he should be started on a new drug regimen to maintain his cholesterol below the target goal of 5 mmol/L.\nWhen the data indicates that this person would meet the NICE recommendation on cholesterol targets, Dr. Li is scheduled to begin treatment. He is still going to be monitored for signs of progression, and if it is noted, will be followed daily for 4-5 weeks before being stopped taking the medication. As an after-effects, the following questions might be addressed along with the following:\n- How do you feel right now? I could not exercise! What emotions do you have right now? What do you remember from your past? How does this exercise relate to your life at the moment?\n- Is there something that you haven't exercised at the moment? How do you feel right now, I cannot exercise right now? What emotions do you have right now? Do you remember anything about yourself that would be interesting or helpful to share during this time next?\n- How do you feel right now, I could not exercise right now? What emotions do you have right now, I am feeling tired; I cannot exercise right now? What can you do right now to help relieve some of the stress? What kind of support do you need right now? Help your loved one to feel good, and also help your loved one to feel motivated to do something to try to improve their lifestyle, reduce stress, and get to where they want to be.\n- What if you had a new activity or exercise that was challenging at the moment? How would you move to do it when you get home? Please describe the exercise you would give your loved one to do.\nIn this scenario, the next step in treatment is to stop taking the cholesterol medication, and Dr. Li would meet with the patient as well as his family and friends, and determine whether or not he should take a new cholesterol medication. He would work with them to figure out how to get the goal cholesterol to reduce the blood cholesterol level to the target point of 5 mmol/L with no changes in his risk factors. After a few months and perhaps years of treatment, Dr. Li will be cleared to come back to continue the new cholesterol medication.\nOn the last slide, he would be sharing the results of the new cholesterol medication. If the patient is a current smoker, he could also add a few of the factors that are linked to other risk factors, namely their age at the time of the blood test, their history of heart disease, their BMI, their family history of CVD, and their smoking history, for example. (There might be a few more points on the slide in case you would like to see them outlined for reference!)\n- Based on the information you provided, how does Dr. Li's experience with this man differ from the previous one?", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30.

John shows no other signs of CVD.\nFigure 1 (a) and (b) show an example of an NHS-approved CVD guideline generated for the Chinese population. The guideline uses a risk model to predict the risk of dying for a cohort. The algorithm compares each person\u2019s personal risk of having incident CVD to the risk of incident CVD for 50 years for the previous 30 years. Patients with the highest (i.e., lowest) risk of heart disease, stroke, or cancer are given a higher death rate. Patients with one-fifth of average risk of CVD, one-half of average risk of CVD, or one-third of average risk of CVD need to be given a greater death rate.\nNHS-licensed guideline generation\nThe following guideline generation tool is freely available on the NHS website. A patient can generate a guideline, which shows the likelihood of a condition due to CVD risk factors, within 48 hours.\nThe NHS guideline generator produces a risk model that includes CVD risk factors. These are selected from 52 categories on the NICE website, along with CVD risks. The calculator below plots the NHS heart disease risk model and shows the model\u2019s predicted risk of dying from CVD, heart disease events, and stroke. You can enter your own risk of heart attack, stroke, or cancer in the boxes. Based on the results, you may want to see whether your patients who are at high risk of CVD are treated differently and may want to discuss this in your practice with your patients.\nThe risk model generates another risk model, which is not available in the NHS-licensed database.\nPatients have 60 hours to complete the test. In the calculator if your patients exceed the 60 hours, they will be asked to repeat the test. The risk of dying from a CVD if they are not over 45 years of age.\nYou can download the patient and provider calculator form from the NHS website. The calculator presents the patient\u2019s risk of CHD and cardiac risk factors. It shows that the model predicts a person\u2019s most likely outcome for the other conditions that could occur.\nIf you use the 52-category risk model generated above, you can give the NHS-licensed calculator the health questionnaire in the third column. The 45-category risk model generated above only predicts which condition the patient may or may not have been diagnosed with. If patients are over 45 years of age, this is the most likely outcome.\nYou can also view the risk model generated by the NHS guideline generator. Your patients want to know about specific CVD conditions. The tool is very simple and has low user training requirements.\nYou can also ask a patient to rate the patients\u2019 risk as a 1-day 1-month average to evaluate their risk for CVD. The score gives you the ratio of a patient\u2019s risk of not having CVD to the risk of having CVD at the same time.\nWe hope the healthcare team you work with understand if your patients can benefit from using this tool. If your patients don\u2019t want to use it at all, please be polite and explain that the risk model you have generated is not a medical diagnosis, and can be used in conjunction with the patient\u2019s own health questionnaire or medical records.\nThis toolkit was adapted from the 2007 Guideline For Risk Assessment And Management Of Hypertension (National Institute For Health and Care Excellence guidelines).

Write down what exactly has happened.\nWhen I was 70, I wasn\u2019t able to exercise or do most of my day-to-day activities like going to the bathroom. I started smoking three times a week, took 800 mg of aspirin a day and started taking my blood pressure lower than my healthy blood pressure. I knew I was at risk for having a heart attack by taking this low BP med but I wasn\u2019t sure what to do about it. To check my blood pressure, I had to go to the doctor and have my blood pressure checked. The reading was 123/80, about 47 mm Hg higher than my healthy blood pressure reading. There was no explanation that made me think I had a problem with my blood pressure. I was quite surprised, but I learned at the same time that taking aspirin also reduced blood pressure. My mom said I was very happy that I learned how to control my high blood pressure.\n2. What do you suppose your heart would do if you took aspirin?\nI don\u2019t know if it is possible that aspirin could cut my blood pressure. My doctor told me that, in a lot of people, it will make their blood pressure lower, but a lot of people take aspirin, so you have to have at least as much control of high blood pressure as someone with a high BP to control their blood pressure.\n3. I don\u2019t think aspirin would cut my risk of having a heart attack, and I think it does protect me from stroke when I start taking blood pressure medications. Do you agree with me?\nI think aspirin is a safe and useful medication for certain people, but I think it does protect me from a heart attack because it lowers my blood pressure. If I didn\u2019t take it, I would be at increased risk of having a heart attack. Also, I think taking aspirin does not protect against stroke because the symptoms are very similar to those of a stroke and some of these people may already have a stroke.\n4. How do you feel now if you get a heart attack?\nI just got a stroke, and I should have been in the hospital about 30 minutes before it happened because my blood pressure was high and my heart was racing. I don\u2019t think I had a heart attack unless I had blood pressure that high for too long.\n5. What are your thoughts if you take aspirin?\nThe best thing I can think about is maybe take it. It would be better to take your blood pressure lower than your healthy blood pressure. That seems like a better thing to do than taking aspirin or using an antihypertensivedrug that reduces your blood pressure.\n6. Can I use this medicine if a stroke or heart attack happened.\nI wish something similar happened like that with heart attacks for people I know at that time.\nMy heart is a little high because I have high blood pressure, and that can make my heart work harder to pump blood.\n7. Would you go back to eating a lot? Why or why not?\nIf I am still able to use my arms, I think I will have to go back to eating meat. That is a lot of food.

Kowalecka, of The New York City Heart Institute & Resuscitation Clinic, offers the best advice we can give. \u201cIt begins with getting a full medical history from your cardiologist or your general practitioner, like Dr. Kowalecka told MedWatch. If that isn\u2019t possible, check your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, BMI, and any other risk factors. This is like asking the doctor, \u201cHow is John?\u201d\nThen we have a physical exam. An ultrasound of the heart to check for any structural abnormalities or signs of disease, like a heart-valve problem or an atrial septal defect. These checks also help determine if there are abnormal heart rhythms, which could be causing John\u2019s problem, like a heart rhythm problem. The ECG, an electrocardiogram, also lets us determine if there are any structural heart problems related to heart disease.\nWe have a detailed history, we can now make sure that John\u2019s cardiac arrest is related to any of these structural changes. We can check for all the underlying heart problems that may be preventing his heart in the future.\u201d\nAnother way to get an accurate picture of your heart health is to monitor your cholesterol and blood pressure regularly and also conduct an exercise test such as a treadmill test. The exercise test can also show if you have high cholesterol and high blood pressure.\nAt The New York Heart Institute, we believe that lifestyle changes are the best way to keep your cardiovascular disease and to keep older people healthier.\nWe often work with senior patients who often talk about how they are going to lose weight as they age. \u201cI once had one of my clients, someone over 80, who told me, \u201cI want to change my diet and stay physically active.\u201d I was able to work with that client to get them on an exercise program and made sure that they could keep their cholesterol under control, and they were able to maintain their level of muscle mass.\u201d\nDr. Kowalecka also encourages people to drink coffee rather than tea. \u201cCoffee has so much caffeine, so it takes your body quite a long time to process it \u2013 it\u2019s not going to get rid of it, it\u2019s going to only get to work for a while,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are drinking coffee, it\u2019s also going to help with your cardiovascular health.\u201d\nHere are some other tips to help you maintain a healthy heart and avoid CVD:\n- Maintain a healthy weight \u2013 Aim to lose at least 5-10 pounds of weight by 2015 and keep moving!\n- Exercise on a regular basis \u2013 30 minutes of exercise three times a week should be enough to maintain optimal cardiovascular health.\n- Don\u2019t smoke \u2013 smoke and other carcinogens affect your heart and lung functions.\n- Eat a healthy diet \u2013 choose a diet that is high in fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, lean proteins, nuts, and fish.\n- If you should see a physician, have them take your blood pressure and screen with a cardiac assessment when you get there. If you have these screenings, discuss the changes you\u2019d like to make.

Each of the above goals must be defined for John, and the healthcare provider will create a plan based on this.\nThe NICE guidelines for John are for the following three types of workouts:\n\u00b7 Cardiorespiratory endurance training of 20min/min plus muscle-strengthening exercises and resistance training for 2 h/week\n\u00b7 Resistance training of 120 min/week\n\u00b7 Strength training of 120 min/week\nFor each of these goals, the NICE guidelines state that the healthcare provider should design the plan based on that goal.\nEach of these types of activity is also important to promote in John. A large majority of John\u2019s lifestyle behaviors, including his sleep quality, are associated with low cardiac fitness. In addition, each of the above goals requires that John perform 30 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week and engage in resistance workouts. Also, according to the NICE guidelines, John needs to complete 40 minutes of physical activity per day, three times per week to strengthen the heart. These times must be broken down by activity type. The best time for all three types of exercise is to be within 30 minutes of a meal before bed or the morning. Physical activity provides a variety of health benefits: a reduction in weight, improved cardiorespiratory function, reduced inflammation, improved blood flow, improved immune function, and reduced risk for cardiovascular disease. John\u2019s health plan for cardiovascular diseases requires that he perform 30 minutes of exercise per week and engage in 40 minutes of resistance training once per week. Also, as described above, physical activity should be part of the pattern of his lifestyle and a daily physical activity level of 30 minutes of exercise per week is recommended. For each of these goals, the NICE guidelines state that the healthcare provider should design the plan based on that goal.\nThe NICE guidelines for John are designed with John in mind to be as effective and appropriate as possible. NICE recommends to do the following:\n\u00b7 Train 20 minutes per day.\n\u00b7 Exercise at least 30 minutes per day but not more than 90 minutes per week.\n\u00b7 Perform more intense exercise than 20 minutes of moderate intensity work.\nThe NICE guidelines for John are for the following three types of recommendations:\n\u00b7 Rest for 10 minutes in between activities and exercise sessions.\n\u00b7 Increase the intensity of the exercise and the workout volume to 40 minutes at moderate speed.\n\u00b7 Change the type of activity to a variety of physical activities (e.g., cardiovascular, strength training, and weight reduction).\nThe guidelines for heart disease are similar to John\u2019s but for what are generally known as \u201ccardio exercise\u201d. These guidelines focus on cardiovascular health for those who have healthy blood pressure; they are specifically targeted for those who smoke (including those who stop), are obese, and have a family history of CVD. For them, the 70-year-old John will have had his annual physical exam at the age of 60 and will be able to participate in regular cardiovascular disease (CKD) screenings. He should perform at least 30 minutes of cardiovascular cardiovascular exercise per day. Because John is a male, these guidelines are for men as well and the 10 minutes per day workout of 10 minutes per session was based on the recommendations for women.\nJohn was asked to perform 40 minutes of exercise per day, three times per week.

He is a physically active young man who has a desire to be in shape. He is aware that his blood pressure is high and wants to be off from any exercise for at least 7 days. He takes a statin, and is now taking 3,000 mg twice a day without doctor-supervised treatment. He has been told that he cannot take a statin without the doctor\u2019s supervision. He also is told that he must take a statin for a minimum of 60 days before he starts a regular exercise program. He is currently taking a total cholesterol of 124 which was adjusted to 134 in 2007 (with a beta-blocker, at 1.0 mg/dL).\nHe is also being told that he also has a low HDL/TG and high LDL/TG without a definitive diagnosis. His cholesterol is now 115 mg/dL and 85 mg/dL without a previous diagnosis of heart failure, with a triglyceride is now 220 mg/dL and 190 mg/dL without a previous diagnosis of diabetes.\nHe is also told that he is a little overweight (a body mass index of 26 kg/m2 with a BMI of 26.7 kg/m2). If he says they have an overall cholesterol of 170,59 mg/dL (but no previous diagnosis of heart failure or diabetes), this makes him feel slight overweight or overweight if the latter, but is of course an absolute contraindication for the cholesterol, and should be given a more specific dietary modification. We agree with his opinion in these situations, as a patient weighing 30kg will not be allowed, or worse, let off without doing a baseline. In my experience, the very low HDL/TG, low LDL/TG, and low LDL/TG are the cause of cardiac dysfunction in healthy people. A very high LDL/TG and very low HDL/TG are the cause of a cardiac hypertric, so even if a patient does NOT do specific dietary modification, they may still increase their LDL/TG if they are overweight, and therefore, they should be given advice on how to moderate this amount to a much higher level than the normal baseline.\nThese are some of the general advice given here as a result of reviewing the evidence on this particular topic. The clinical practice guidelines, particularly by the American Heart Association in 2008 (AHA guideline 7), suggest that for all patients who are overweight or obese and have a BP of >130 mmHg in the lower extremities, they should be advised to reduce their total cholesterol (45%), reduce their triglycerides (15%) and increase their HDL \u2013 value (10%). If they have a systolic value of <100 mmHg in the lower extremities and their HDL \u2013 value is <25%, that should be followed; and if it is >25%, that should be restricted to a daily intake of >320 mg/kg/day.\nSo, in this particular case, what we have just seen is that all of this advice has been issued on the basis of evidence based clinical practice guidelines rather than medical advice!\nThe bottom line is, we are not going to make that kind of a decision on ourselves. We are going to consult with our primary care physician and ask her what the recommendation is \u2013 based on the evidence \u2013 and get on with what she offers.\nWhat does it mean for John?\nWhen the patient asks for advice on how to reduce their systolic cholesterol, they are not being encouraged to eat their vegetables and eat healthy fats and to change their lifestyle. The only recommendation they are given, is that they should begin a low fat eating plan, followed by limiting processed foods (particularly saturated and trans fats), so that the intake of saturated fats do not exceed a limit of 5% of their total FAT intake. There is no suggestion that John should be increasing his calorie intake, especially if he is already obese, or even if he is a healthy weight, because even if that is not the case, if John is already obese, and has hypertension or a history of high blood pressure, it is not sensible to try to achieve a moderate or lower body weight.\nHow much advice to they are given?\nIf it comes from a healthcare professional or physician, as opposed to a person who has already tried and", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30.

The pancreas, the body's \"master gland\", is an amazing machine that is constantly on the lookout for energy.\nInsulin is a hormone, produced by the pancreas, that regulates the body's how glucose -- a simple sugar obtained in the diet -- is reacted to and used by the body cells.\nIf your blood sugar is not enough, glucose (which is a simple sugar) cannot be used by the body cells, and the brain and other organs cannot supply energy to the cells properly.\nTherefore, in order to perform the metabolic reaction at the fastest rate, glucose levels in the blood must be constantly at or above the normal blood level. (This is termed hyperglycemia or hyperglycemia).\nNormal blood glucose levels are:\n> 6-10 mmol/L\n(200-1400 mg/dL or 125-700 nanograms/L)\n> 5.0-6.9 mmol/L\n(100 to 127 mg/dL or 50-690 nanograms/L)\n> 4.6 to 5.3 mmol/L\n> 2.6 to 3.9 mmol/L (33 to 66 mg/dL or 40-97 Nanograms per liter)\nHyponatremia: Hyponatremia, or low blood sodium levels, is a side effect to a large number of medications.\nSome examples of medications that are associated with hyponatremia include diuretics, ACE inhibitors (high blood pressure medication) and NSAIDs (the most commonly used medication in this condition is aspirin).\nSymptoms of Hyponatremia include confusion (inattention) or irritability but are not usually associated with physical collapse (such as a cardiac arrest) and include seizures.\nIn general, we need to know if a patient with hypotension or hyponatremia is more susceptible to hyponatremia-induced seizures.

The research is being guided by the UK Heart Foundation, the UK Agency for Research on Cancer (NICE) and the NICE Obesity and Health and Fitness Working Party.

According to the information provided in that article, the criteria for diagnosing CVD includes a four-digit classification scale ranging from 1 to 9 where each dot represents a 'threshold'. Of course, calculating the exact value for the patient's blood pressure at this point would require quite a bit of mathematical power! That's when I realized how different diagnoses are - while heart disease and cardiovascular issues are primarily evaluated using ICD-9 codes, these categories differ fundamentally from traditional physical age, as noted in most European countries. Instead, the assessment focuses solely on the medical history of the sick person, seeking to identify any potential underlying factors contributing to the disease.\n\nAs we discuss potential therapies and treatments, it becomes clear that some aspects of CVD may be better addressed based on those criteria. For instance, certain heart and vascular disease can present differently depending on the individual's age, gender, ethnicity, and overall health. By tailoring care accordingly, we aim to minimize unnecessary suffering and improve outcomes for those affected.\n\nAt this point, I reached my conclusion, and I couldn't wait to hear a different perspective! To make sense of everything I had learned, I turned towards the very first question about my medical history and symptoms. This time around, I delved into the details of my diagnosis, including my blood pressure and family history of CVD, all within the context of the proposed CVD guidelines. It seemed impossible to achieve this level of expertise without breaking down the process into even smaller pieces. But then again, it makes me appreciate this moment so much more than simply having the most refined knowledge of the subject.\n\nIn the end, though I had no easy answers or clear-cut solutions. However, taking a step back and considering both the challenges and opportunities posed by modern healthcare practices and technological advances, I discovered that sometimes our quest for answers can lead us to unexpected discoveries about ourselves and others \u2013 just like finding this gem of content on the Amazon Twitch channel.", "Considering John's demographics and health status - a 70-year-old Chinese male, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, free of diabetes, with a family history of CVD - what would be the NICE CVD guidelines applicable to him?\n1) The NICE guideline on the heart disease is based upon age standardised and life time data for heart disease.

This group can then be referred to a cardiac care team. The majority of the studies to date have been observational studies which are aimed at screening for CVD in the community to try and identify those at highest risk of future CVD.\nIn a recent survey of 97 primary care hospitals in England and 1460 general practices in Wales, NICE suggested that patients older than 40 should be offered at-risk people's' CVD screening.\nThe Heart Foundation recommends screening patients over 50 at high cardiovascular health risk. It is recommended that they be followed to make sure that symptoms persist after diagnosis of CHD.\nIn a report last year, the American Medical Association (AMA) urged doctors to do routine screening of the general public for CVD including the detection of new smoking risk factors and that young adults between 18-39 years should be screened for hypertension annually, as well as cholesterol.\nThere should be a screening scheme for asymptomatic men in their 40s who are in their 50s-55s and those 60+ and men under 45 should be screened once a year for hypertension, for tobacco use and for metabolic abnormalities.\nAnother Cochrane review of 15 studies on the screening of coronary heart disease was published last year in May. It found that the treatment of patients diagnosed with high cardiovascular risk was associated with an increased risk of premature death, a significantly higher risk of dying early and an increased risk of developing heart failure.\nNICE guidelines advise that treatment of existing CAD should include treatment, at least as effective as the treatment for high CVD risk, that is 12-15% improvement in disease activity. A limitation of this approach is that it cannot be used for the more common cases of high CVD risk or those where there is increased risk of recurrent events of CAD or heart failure; it cannot be used in those with known CAD or in patients with an increased CAD risk but is not a suitable option for patients with a history of a heart attack.\nIn 2007, the American Society for Pacemakers published Guideline 36 for the Management of Patients with Heart Attack\n, which states: Heart attack is not a symptom, it is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention, and the physician should provide the most appropriate care to the patient based on the individual patient in terms of prognosis and patient's wishes.\nNICE has provided a 2010 review of the role of exercise, lifestyle modification and diet in the treatment of patients with diabetes. An analysis of the 2010 Cochrane Review of interventions in patients with peripheral arterial disease revealed that dietary interventions of lower carbohydrate intake (4 cups) led to a 41% reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular events, of diabetes complications and of amputation.\nThese are just two pointers from NICE which indicate important steps in the management of a serious heart disease patient. However, as a general rule, patients can and should be treated with a comprehensive care plan for his or her special needs (particularly if they already have CVD) or with at least the intervention mentioned above which will meet their specific needs.\nPlease report any medical or practical difficulties you may be having to us on email@example.com or call us (020 7260 0277)\nFor more information about Cardiology at RHS\n, please visit our website at: www.rhs.org.uk/cardiology", "Considering John's demographics and health status - a 70-year-old Chinese male, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, free of diabetes, with a family history of CVD - what would be the NICE CVD guidelines applicable to him?\n(a) Diabetes\n(b) Hypercholesterolemia\n(c) Hyperlipidaemia and heart disease\n(d) None of the above\n\n##### Correct Answer: Option 1 (Solution Below)\n\n2.

In case of a patient over age 65, what should the NICE guidelines apply to his health status? How could we interpret these findings together? Describe.\nAnswer: NICE recommends the treatment of heart failure primarily via cardiopulmonary bypass. The management of this condition should be carried out via ICU with intensive care. The management of heart failure is focused on prevention of complications and the avoidance of mechanical circulatory support with the addition of the use of an artificial heart valve. The indications for using this procedure are severe heart failure that requires the use of the artificial heart (to provide artificial heart flow). A heart failure patient who is not able to tolerate treatment with the artificial heart should receive additional intervention such as replacement of residual heart tissue using an artificial heart (to replace the heart tissue). The indications for the use of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are if the patient is unable to tolerate additional interventions (such as the use of the artificial heart) or if the patient has a contraindicate risk factor for coronary artery bypass (such as elevated cholesterol levels). The indications for the use of PCI are as described in Section IV.\nThe following factors are essential for the cardiology of adult patients: The condition of the person before and during the hospital stay, he or she is a healthy individual, the patient has a correct level of function (as indicated by tests) and the physician is aware of the illness. The cardiology of adults is carried out during hospital admission, usually in the intensive care unit. The management of patients with acute heart failure is based on cardiopulmonary bypass.\nThis review identifies the cardiovascular risk factors and risk factors for heart failure, which may be responsible for developing cardiovascular disease and that may worsen the course of the disease.\nKey questions have been asked that relate to risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis and the potential for coronary atherosclerosis from risk factors.\nThe mechanisms that can lead to atherosclerotic vascular disease (AVA) and heart failure have been described. The mechanisms responsible for the risk of AVA and heart failure in adults have been investigated. The authors have reviewed the literature concerning cardiovascular, non-cardiovascular risk factors and factors, and the potential for AAV to occur in young patients in the context of the current American Heart Association guideline.\nWith respect to risk factors for AVA and heart failure, the following will be addressed.\nThe mechanisms responsible for the formation of atherosclerotic vascular disease (AVA) have been described (O'Neil, 1999). The mechanism by which atherosclerotic vascular disease (atherosclerosis) can be prevented and the development of arterial disease in the presence of risk factors for cardiovascular etiology is a known problem. This problem may occur even if a patient's risk factors are of the same type as the individual's. The risk factors for CAD or AAV and heart failure could be classified as risk factors for atherosclerosis. The risk factors of a coronary artery and a left ventricular artery aneurysm for CAD and AAV are commonly the same as those for a patient's underlying atherosclerotic disease. The mechanism by which risk factors for AAV can occur in association with atherosclerosis is unknown. While both the risk factors for atherosclerosis and AAV exist, the mechanisms for AAV formation and the development of AAV are different (Cui, 2006).\nThe pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and heart failure is the formation and development of atherosclerotic plaques in the walls of blood vessels. This process has involved a sequence of events in which fatty plaques called atheromas are deposited at the end of intimal and medial mesenchymal elements of the arterial wall (Rosenquist and Heckman, 1999). The development of these plaques does not happen in a free state and is associated with the accumulation of fat in these atheromatous lesions. The formation of a plaque is accompanied by the release of enzymes called triglycerides and cholesterol from the endothelium into the circulation. Over time, these substances accumulate in the walls of blood vessels and form plaques of varying size and composition (Tang, 1997). Over time, plaques can begin to form more resistant areas of the articular surfaces that may eventually lead to the rupture of the plaque. The rupture of a plaque may result in the occlusion of the vessel and result in blockage of the affected tissue, which leads to ischemia (Aveivi et al., 2006). The formation of plaque leads to an increase in the viscosity of the plaque, which is associated with an increase in the formation of atheromatous lesions.

There are five things that need to be understood: \u2022 The type of heart disease; \u2022 Risk factors that you can control; \u2022 Symptoms you can detect without taking medicines; \u2022 The current best medicines when heart disease is suspected; \u2022 The signs and symptoms most useful for determining treatment if a patient is at risk of or being diagnosed with atherosclerosis. An EKGs monitor the amount of lipids (liquids) in the blood. One of the best ways to know if you have elevated lipid levels is through an EKGs. Here is a diagram of how EKGs work. The 'EKG' stands for Electrocardiogram, a test used to determine the heart's electrical conduction system. The EKG is a painless test; it is painless to the most sensitive areas. The test works by detecting electrical impulses to the heart in real time, creating an image of the heart and providing important information on its health. Heart rate, rhythm, strength and blood pressure. A person's EKG results are typically measured in the early morning hours (to avoid morning blood-sucking) and recorded in detail. The test can occur with or without treatment, but should only be undertaken if indicated. The EKG is the most commonly used screening test for heart disease. If the test is normal, the test is done again, but to be sure of the results, a second EKG will also be done. If the test results are abnormal, then an EKG is done to rule out an underlying condition such as coronary artery disease. This exam may also be used to look for signs of other disorders such as diabetes. The EKG test cannot provide a definitive diagnosis of a heart disease. The test can provide information about blood pressure and lipid levels, but most important is that EKGs can reveal indications of other heart disease conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease and hypertension. If blood pressure appears normal (less than 120/80) then the result will be interpreted as normal or within range. An EKGs test can also detect the presence of other heart conditions including heart valve disease, pericarditis, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy and heart failure. In these cases a heart-CT scan or MRI may also be used. You also get an EKG test to see if your blood flow is normal even after you've had no symptoms. EKGs are used to monitor a person's heart function until the condition is established. Your doctor may also review the test if your condition is stable or a pacemaker or implantable defibrillator is needed. You may also receive an electrocardiogram as a pre-procedure. You will be required to stay in the hospital while ECG is done. You will probably get to rest for at least 6 hours after the test until the electrodes are removed. You can resume your normal activities after the test. The test is painless, but may take between 5 and 15 minutes at a minimum. During the test you will lie on a table and your heart rate, blood pressure, breathing pattern and electrical activity will be monitored. No wires or other tools are used during the procedure. During the test you will lie on the couch with your arms and legs straight. The machine you hold in your hand on the chest wall. The electrodes will be placed over your chest area. You may feel a throbbing sensation within the test area. Some people find the feeling of the electrodes on their skin to be unpleasant. You may feel some discomfort after the EKG test. You will be asked not to eat, drink and cough for at least five minutes as a precaution. You may feel some discomfort initially and some light discomfort afterwards. The electrodes also can cause some discomfort at first. Once you have completed the test, you should be able to eat and drink normally. You may also feel nauseous to the touch. This is similar to symptoms of heart failure. The EKG test usually takes just one full-day of a 24-hour care period. Your doctor will discuss this during his/her visit. The EKG test is normally done right in your doctor's office. The doctors' office, in a sterile location, ensures a minimal risk to you and your patient. You will be watched for any discomfort and pain during the test time that you can tolerate. During the test you may be asked to lie down on your side with your arm resting at heart-side and the other arm at leg-side. You will then lie on your stomach. You may be required to lie with no head or neck movements and/or neck and chest movements.

If he has all the criteria for a CVD-like diagnosis and his age in years, he should be diagnosed with a cardiovascular episode at least twice and the patient with a history of CVD or a previous episode should be monitored at regular intervals. If his age was determined to fall between 23 to 35 years, he should be a patient of 21 or more comorbidities listed in his EMD and a high FVC level. Is it even possible to do this? In the meantime, does his age and history have an impact on your decision?\n4. Can you talk about what could be done to improve your patient's quality of life even if it is only a little difficult to get approval to pursue your plan?\nIf patients with chronic illnesses were more likely to have access to a clinical study, the number of non-clinical studies that would not cause the same negative impact as the clinical study was reduced by one third.\nThis is because clinicians can recommend or recommend the cost to patients so the costs that will be passed on to patients are lower than what the clinical studies might have cost. It is not possible to say that a patient has access to a new type of study like for example \"novel interventions\". But the data supporting their use suggests that the level of use is already starting to increase for this clinical practice in general, and that the costs of these trials would be much lower than what is actually needed.\nIn addition to reducing the cost of new studies, the use of a specific clinical trial can also help patients save money. For example, there have been some publications that show that patients who have undergone an elective procedure, for example a hip replacement that includes a hip-elbow pump and a catheter in the groin, benefit from their use of a clinical trial when it is also known that it is known that the patient could be more durable with their exercise program. The use of clinical trials in chronic illnesses is not a priority.\nHowever, there is already evidence that the benefits of using a specific clinical trial would be greater if the patient participated in the trial on his own. For example, in a recently published article it was proved that a study on exercise could potentially help patients with coronary heart disease by significantly increasing their HDL cholesterol levels. To prove this, one of the participants in the study was a patient with an advanced case of myocardial infarction (heart attack), who showed to have an abnormal T2DM (type 2 diabetes) and had poor physical activity levels. This patient participated in a clinical trial and they had a reduction in blood lipids in a very significant result. These results point to a strong correlation between exercise and the reduction of HbA1c (sugar level) in such patients.\nTherefore, in cases with a high risk of CVD, it will be important not only to study medical interventions, but also to study clinical interventions. For example, it would be very interesting to study whether patients who do not have the potential benefit of exercising and consuming an anti-inflammatories may simply stop exercising and suffer adverse effects from the exercise. There also might be clinical trials to study exercise not only in chronic cases, but in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients who have already undergone a blood test or diagnosis of cardiovascular disease because of some genetic predisposition.\nBut are the results still relevant in other clinical settings too?\nThis is true at the level of our populations and at that point we take into account that there could be benefits of this study being performed because we feel that patients, even in certain cases and at the very least, will benefit if we use a clinical study to study the efficacy of interventions like diet, diet pills, and exercise. We are not talking that they would not apply to these cases themselves, we are talking that we are considering the fact that these therapies could be further evaluated if patients are randomized in groups.\nRegarding the patient's lifestyle in general, we don't believe that exercise and diet are sufficient to help patients who have type-2 diabetes. On the contrary, in many cases a diet pill has not been proven to help their patients nor does it influence their blood cholesterol levels. In some cases, we believe that patients who have type-2 diabetes can use an exercise program because it may help with their diet, but they actually have to have a diagnosis. Therefore, we see that exercise is always a better option for them than diet pills.\nOn the other hand, we would also take into account the benefit that exercise could offer to patients who have had a heart attack and not had any risk factors that could affect their blood lipids. These patients are already given a", "Considering John's demographics and health status - a 70-year-old Chinese male, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, free of diabetes, with a family history of CVD - what would be the NICE CVD guidelines applicable to him?\n3. What is the main challenge of CVD prevention in Asian-American populations?\nThe 10% of the population that is non-white is likely to be at the risk of cardiovascular disease, and the high prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome further complicates the issue. It has been found that the association between higher blood pressure and a greater risk of cardiovascular diseases is stronger in Asian Americans than in non-Hispanic White Americans.\n4. What are some of the best known lifestyle changes that can be adopted to improve the health of patients with CVD?\nIncreasing physical activity and weight loss are two important actions that can be taken. The patient has the right to exercise, but not in combination with diet. Being overweight will make it difficult to lead a healthy lifestyle. Weight loss through dieting but not through exercise is also not recommended. If blood pressure is controlled by a healthy weight, lifestyle changes like quitting smoking and exercising 30 min on rest days are encouraged. An exercise programme that includes cardiovascular exercise is important to treat hypertension, and this should be started when lifestyle changes are already being followed.\n5. Is a patient that is diagnosed with CVD currently receiving a chronic medical condition that would benefit from lifestyle modifications?\nMany patients with CVD are eligible for lifestyle modification. If a patient is being treated for a chronic condition and taking oral medications on a regular basis, they can still benefit from lifestyle modifications. The patient's weight, age, and family history are factors to be taken into consideration. A positive lifestyle may promote cardiovascular disease, or it may be a long-term strategy for managing another problem for which the patient is currently being treated.\n6. Will a patient diagnosed with CVD be prescribed oral medications or undergo medication therapy?\nThe majority of CVD is controlled by medications, and medication therapy may include statins and ACE inhibitors. The American Heart Association has a good working definition of CVD medications: \"Medications include:\n\u2022 Antihypertensives (hypertension\n\u2022 Thiazides(chlorothiazide)\u2022 ACE Inhibitors(niacin)\n\u2022 Beta-blockers(atenolol)\u2022 Calcium Channel Blockers (amlodipine (nifedipine\n\u2022 Albuterol(albuterol)\u2022 Propranolol(analgesic)\u2022 Angiotensin III Receptor Blockers(vasodilators)\u2022 Nicardipine(corticosteroids)\n\u2022 Diuretics(lansoprazol)\n\u2022 Diltiazem(cardithrine)\u2022 Fosinopril and others\"\nNote that these medications will vary in cost depending on which medications. The prescription fees depend on several factors including the age of the drug, the type of medication, and the prescribed dose.\nMedicines for a patient are not available in all countries.\n7. How can patients who have a family history of CVD address their condition effectively?\nA large range of lifestyle changes can improve blood pressure and cholesterol. These are usually the two most important factors when fighting cardiovascular risk. If you are concerned about a family medical history of CVD, please contact your healthcare provider first.\n8. In order for a patient to adhere to these medication changes, how does the patient or their family member benefit financially and emotionally?\nStudies show that a patient may be able to reduce their medical expenses as part of a patient's treatment plan, as well as support a loved one who cares for them. Some forms of medication are also designed to aid in weight management, which can be very valuable for patients with CVD.\n9. What can you do for patients that have been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease?\nIf you are not sure where to start, there are a number of resources on the Internet. The most recent is the 2011 American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines in Cardiology. These guidelines provide the most current, evidence-based information about CVD and the interventions that can be used to treat it.\n10. Can patients have CVD as an illness?\nNo. People with CVD are more at risk for other illnesses. Patients may also have some type of mental illness, for example anxiety or depression, chronic disease complications, and an increased risk of death due to the physical and mental symptoms of CVD.\n11. Can patients with CVD live longer than non-victims of CVD?\nIn fact, if you can avoid or delay a certain time period where your health could be affected by CVD (such as when a patient has a heart attack) you do not really matter when this time period is over", "Considering John's demographics and health status - a 70-year-old Chinese male, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, free of diabetes, with a family history of CVD - what would be the NICE CVD guidelines applicable to him?

What measures do we need to take to avoid dying from a CV injury? The answer to this question should always be: the heart and the lung.\nThe next set of questions were to:\n- what interventions would decrease the incidence of death from CV and its consequences (including: the need for a heart attack)\n- which interventions would reduce the incidence of death from CV (including: the need for a heart attack)\n- what interventions would enhance the cardiac function of young people (starting a cardiac rehab programme)\n- what interventions would enhance the cardiac function of older people (starting a cardiovascular exercise programme)?\n- which interventions would enhance the myocardial function of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)\n- which interventions would enhance the cardiac function of peripheral bypass (PABG)", "Considering John's demographics and health status - a 70-year-old Chinese male, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, free of diabetes, with a family history of CVD - what would be the NICE CVD guidelines applicable to him?\n\nTo answer your two postings, first of all, there are multiple factors when it came to evaluating heart disease. The first, and most commonly-discussed, is a body mass index (BMI) more than 30. If a person's BMI is > 30, there is a high risk of heart disease. For example, the British Heart Foundation (BHF) suggests a healthy BMI depends on an individual's age and sex. When BMI becomes 30-body mass index (BMI>30), the probability of having heart disease is about 20-30% in the general population. This would not be considered high risk, but a significant increase in heart risk would mean the individual would be considered \"obese\".\n\nSecond is a number of factors to be considered, but this is where the common denominator emerges. While a young population can develop cardiovascular disease, the likelihood in adulthood increases drastically for those with a history of coronary heart disease (CHD) or a family history of CHD because their heart is likely to have additional abnormalities. Also, as you mention in your first response, an individual's diabetes history might be an indicator, but there are more common factors to consider also: a family history, age, and gender. Therefore, you must take into consideration a few factors, but a single set of characteristics would only be representative.\n\nThe third consideration relates to your second, much more recent posting - specifically, what is the general consensus from the BHF/British Heart Foundation about lifestyle changes for CVD prevention and management. They consider physical activity, diet, smoking cessation, and screening for diabetes and other conditions that can put an individual at risk. While diet for heart disease prevention remains important, screening for diabetes and other conditions will certainly increase your risk. The overall focus is on lifestyle changes, but the specific recommendations of these groups are in the comment.\n\n##### Share on other sites\nWhat does a \"heart healthy\" body mass index (BMI) of 30 do?\n\nIt is a value that is based on an estimated individual's age and height.

Jul 15, 2014\n\n### Staff: Mentor\n\nThis isn't a very important answer, and could be a great one in a future year! So I'll just summarize.\n\nAll other things held constant, cholesterol is a good predictor of cardiovascular disease - that's what everyone says. Cholesterol is also a good predictor of diabetes, the major cause of heart disease and stroke. And we don't know for sure what our recommendations are for blood pressure, which is the best predictor of cardiovascular disease. For these reasons, it's not good to give blood pressure measurements using a standard blood pressure meter.\n\nThe current medical guidelines recommend that the total cholesterol intake is 300 mg a day without exception. The current blood pressure guideline prescribes 120/80 if blood pressure measurements are between a systolic (top) and a diastolic (bottom) measurement. However, these are not the only blood pressure guidelines we read in the United States, and so I'd suggest we see if one is better than another if we know why. Our current blood pressure guidelines aren't so bad; the goal is slightly above healthy but not nearly as high as the British guideline, so this is a bad case of misguided medical advice.\n\n#### Attached Files:\n\n\u2022 ###### 1 2 3 4 a.png\nFile size:\n4.6 KB\nViews:\n36\nLast edited by BossY19: Oct 7, 2014\n3.

The reason I'm a little uncomfortable about cholesterol is because all my experiences with cholesterol have been with the same thing. The problem I encounter is with a person with a different body composition; all people have a different body composition as we move across the body and across organs. If we think about cholesterol we're talking about two things: a fat and a cholesterol. If you're overweight, your cholesterol will increase; if you're underweight, your cholesterol will decrease.\n\nThe good news is, cholesterol can be removed from the circulation, and then your lipid profile can be improved.

The first NICE guideline, for screening individuals who are at increased risk of CVD, is to begin routine screening of adults aged 50 to 70 years at the average age of 55 years. In these individuals, the aim is to identify patients who may be at risk through a structured questionnaire. For individuals who are aged 75 years and over, the primary purpose is to identify individuals at greater risk for CVD, such as older population and family members and patients at risk for cardiovascular disease other than due to age or other medical conditions, with their primary care physician. The screening tool for each group may differ: For individuals aged 50-70 years, use the 200mg/dL or lower and the 200mg/dL or lower and the 200mg/dL/over the age of 19 years. For individuals aged 75-82 years, the 200mg/dL or lower and the 100mg/dL/over the age of 49 and older can also be used, but the person should have their blood pressure measured after this age range. The 100mg/dL dose can only be used for children under age 18. For 100mg/dL or lower groups, people should be monitored throughout their lives, so both of the following situations are appropriate. Those diagnosed with diabetes at an average age of 75 years or older who have an ideal BP range and without previous CVD history should have regular blood pressure and cholesterol measurements. Individuals with or without a family history of CVD and/or diabetes are eligible for the 200mg/dL or lower dose, and have both baseline and a blood pressure and cholesterol measurements as indicated. These groups may also be eligible for other measures, including LDL cholesterol screening, as appropriate.\nWhen determining if the patient is at risk for CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for screening asymptomatic individuals with no known risk factors for CVD? Screening asymptomatic individuals with no known risk factors for CVD will be conducted with a validated form for screening, which can be done by a physician or a nurse. Screening is then performed using the standard NICE guidelines as outlined above. For asymptomatic individuals with a normal BMI and/or healthy lipid profile, the NICE guidelines for cholesterol testing and lipoprotein cholesterol testing should be used.\nWhat are the NICE guidelines for treating overweight or obesity? The NICE guidelines are for treating overweight or obese individuals with metabolic syndrome and/or cardiovascular disease. The NICE guidelines for treating overweight or obese individuals with metabolic syndrome and/or cardiovascular disease will include:\n- 600mg/Kg of calorie diet for at least three months\n- Lifestyle and nutrition modifications as warranted\n- When appropriate, referral to a qualified dietician or a nurse specializing in nutrition\n- When appropriate, referral to a licensed mental health professional for counselling and stress management training\n- When appropriate, referral to a licensed diabetes educator for diabetes self-management education\n- If medically indicated, referral to an endocrinologist\n- Any underlying medical problems\n- 1000mg/Kg of caloric dietary diet if weight is <75 kg or a 5% weight reduction or other modification\n- 75kg or less (weight for height) daily\n- If age over 75\n- 1330mg-lol (1330mg-kgs of energy density/kg of body weight) daily for first target\n- If age over 75\n- 2500mg-lol (2500 mg-kgs of energy density/kg of body weight) daily for the next target\n- For older adults:\n- If age 75+ or older\n- 2000mg-lol (2000 mg-kgs of energy density/kg of body weight) daily for the next target\n- If age less than 75\nWhat are the NICE guidelines for preventing cardiovascular disease? The NICE guidelines for preventing cardiovascular disease are for screening asymptomatic individuals at the age of 20 years and older and for screening asymptomatic individuals with a history of hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The screening includes a validated form for screening, which can be done by a physician or a nurse. Screening is then performed using the validated form from the screening stage. Screening is then performed using the validated form for diagnosing cardiovascular disease and in the case of CVD, the 90-9", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\nThere are five heart conditions that make it more likely for someone to get cardiovascular disease. They are a heart attack, stroke, or sudden cardiac arrest of the heart or its parts.\nA person with these heart conditions is considered at a high risk and should start a heart healthy lifestyle before having a heart attack, high blood pressure, or stroke. NICE guidelines recommend following the following heart healthy lifestyle:\n- eating a low-fat diet, including more high-fiber foods\n- regular and moderate exercise, ranging from five to 150 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic activity on non-consecutive days\n- no smoking (no second hand smoking, no secondhand smoke)\n- a healthy BMI, including not using extra weight, if you are too heavy.\nFor more detailed information about cardiovascular risk factors or specific guidance for your risk assessment, you can read the individual heart health guidelines on the NICE website.\nNICE recently released some guidelines on smoking cessation. The NICE guidelines recommend getting an NHS smokefree policy in the workplace, as well as setting a quit date for current smokers. On the NHS, smoking cessation is free.\nLast year the NICE guidelines included a discussion about how to help people living with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The recommendations encourage people with CKD to:\n- stop smoking\n- choose tobacco free products, including nicotine replacement products\n- visit the GP regularly for check-ups, including screening for hypertension and diabetes, and cholesterol\n- have a blood pressure, blood sugar and blood pressure test on a regular basis\nPeople with CKD still have a hard time quitting smoking\nThe NICE guidelines are the best available evidence for people living with CKD. These guidelines can help guide medical services that treat people with kidney disease, such as dialysis or renal transplantation, but they don\u2019t tell everyone the same thing. They also do not recommend every treatment for how people with kidney disease should respond to the medicines they are prescribed. These guidelines are, so far, the most current information in the world. So this doesn\u2019t mean every case is the same, just that there is more evidence now to support certain guidelines than to say they are not worth following.\nFor information on how to get support for people living with chronic kidney disease, click here.\nWhat is my risk of getting a heart attack?\nYou can take steps to reduce your risk for cardiovascular diseases or heart attack. You don\u2019t need to give up your favourite food or start a new exercise routine, but following a heart healthier lifestyle can greatly reduce your risk of getting a heart attack or dying from cardiovascular disease.\nNICE recommends following these guidelines for both type 1 and type 2 cardiovascular disease:\n- getting an NHS heart healthy policy, such as a healthy BMI and a low-fat diet, as well as a high quality lifestyle \u2013 at a high level\n- having regular blood pressure, cholesterol and blood glucose checks\n- getting a physical or exercise routine with daily or nearly daily exercise, including 30 minutes \u2013 more \u2013 with physical activity, such as cycling, walks, and playing sport\n- stopping smoking as a starting point\n- choosing tobacco free products, including nicotine replacement products\n- having regular checks of blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose levels, if needed\nFinally, NICE recommended:\n- having a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and wholegrain foods, as well as fish and meat \u2013 for good heart health\n- eating the minimum suggested portion size, including 30g protein for breakfast, lunch and dinner\n- drinking no more than 300ml of alcohol per day, with 1 glass of wine, a single occasion, per week,\n- getting exercise at least 30 minutes most days of the week.\nFollow these guidelines to improve your heart health.\nWhat does a healthy cholesterol level look like?\nIf you\u2019ve had cholesterol tests in the last 5 years, your LDL level might be more than 130 mg/dL (the \u201cbad\u201d part). If your LDL level is more than 160 mg/dL, it can lead to a condition called dyslipidemia, which is a big deal, as it increases the risk that you have a heart attack.\nHow do I know if my blood pressure is above 140/90 or below 90?\nCheck out the blood pressure chart above (click on the picture to get a bigger version)\nSee also a healthy blood pressure chart and the risk of heart and heart disease.\nDo", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\nThe best approach is to try to keep your blood pressure under the safe level (a systolic pressure of less than 120 mmHg or a diastolic pressure of less than 80 mmHg), and as we have seen, smoking and having a family history of CVD are risk factors that need to be addressed.\nSo if you take action as a smoker, start smoking now. And if you are a non-smoker, don\u2019t give up (the answer is probably not smoking a cigarette). Once the danger of smoking is understood and quitted, you have the opportunity to improve your health.\nHowever, keep in mind there is a lot that you can do to reduce your risk of CVD. A diet like this is recommended, as well as exercise. However, keep in mind what you\u2019re doing here, is for the public good.\nThe public good is based on the need to save lives. Let me give you a couple of examples. If all smokers die from heart attacks and strokes, it has to be done because it is important\u2014that saving lives can be achieved.\nSo the public good is to reduce deaths from CVD. And if I take you on a hike, and as I walk up and down the trail, where does I see people smoke?\nNot too far from here, too near here! Not too far from here, too near here.\nIf you\u2019re a smoker and you\u2019re walking the trail, where do you see that smoke?\nIt\u2019s on the end of the trail. It\u2019s on the end of the trail.\nNow I\u2019m a smoker here. And I\u2019m walking in my driveway. I\u2019m not at this destination, on my way to the town. And the smoke can\u2019t find me.\nSo it\u2019s not in my driveway, or my driveway, but in my driveway, in my driveway, in my driveway.\nIt\u2019s here, where is it now?\nSo now I\u2019m walking down the road, I have been driving on the highway for about 3 miles.\nSo it\u2019s kind of hard to know if I didn\u2019t run across the trails, and I should be avoiding these areas while I continue on down the road.\nBut I do have an incentive to avoid some of these places that I think are probably potentially harmful because they may contain a lot of smoking and it would be easy for that person to get cigarettes and tobacco products if they were in a certain path.\nOne thing I want to discuss in this section is alcohol, especially for people under the age of 21. So I\u2019m not sure how many people I am working with here.\nSo this is because we don\u2019t know if people 21 or older, who smoke, are at high risk for heart attacks and strokes. But we are in this journey of the health care system that started in the 1940s because the number of deaths from CVD has been growing very hard to do without any health care services. So to keep our patients getting care from these new medicines, new doctors all over the country are needed.\nAnd that is the need for new ways to protect health because most people don\u2019t have treatment for heart attacks and strokes. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying that we could never have an adequately funded health care system with our health care system as a whole.\nSo what is the evidence we have of this? We know that if we are going at a low rate of smoking and are drinking in moderation (two or fewer drinks per day), you have a 15% lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared with a person who drinks and has smoked, or has smoked and has had a cardiovascular event.\nNow, I think this is consistent evidence from studies, but the only one that\u2019s been done among smokers and those who smoke, has had one effect\u2014and I\u2019m sure it may also make us wiser, because no one ever told them about these findings. But that study was done over 10 years ago. The fact that it was not done in the past for a study, shows us that it\u2019s better for both smokers and those who smoke to avoid cigarettes\u2014and it\u2019s also better for a country\u2014where there\u2019s a high rate of CVD, and where heart disease is a big contributor and is a cause.\nSo I\u2019m sure there are thousands of cases of heart disease, but it could be the opposite. I\u2019m not sure if", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\n- An important consideration when a patient is being examined for coronary heart disease and who has no clinical risk factors is that the first step in cardiology is to calculate the risk of cardiac death based on all the patient\u2019s medical information. The first step is to determine that risk by looking at the following factors:\n- Coronary Heart Disease\n- Smoking and related diseases\n- Other related diseases\n- Other risk factors for heart disease\n- Additional risks identified by the assessment include lifestyle, genetics, medication, genetic factor, previous heart attacks, and high cholesterol.\n- The results of the coronary heart disease screening should be discussed with the patient.\n- An additional consideration in the cardiac risk assessment is the potential risk of a blood clot developing within the heart. A blood clot in the deep veins, known as venous thrombosis, can cause a thrombus that can get to the heart where it grows, causing a heart attack. Identifying and taking steps to prevent it is essential.\n- The first step is to evaluate the risk of developing heart attack and subsequent thrombosis related to this procedure. The risk of getting cardiac events from this procedure can also be determined by discussing this risk if a patient is obese or overweight, or is a smoker.\n- Finally, if the patient is being evaluated for heart failure there could be other screening information associated with the cardiac risk assessment. When screening includes discussing the risk of developing a heart attack, for example, a patient has a family history of heart failure should discuss with the staff for further clarification about a family history and follow-up care recommendations.\n- An important consideration in the cardiovascular risk assessment is that a cardiologist has performed risk assessment into the possibility of taking a heart medication. An additional consideration is that a patient taking blood thinners carries a risk of having a blood clot build up.\n- Patients are being evaluated if they or a family member has been diagnosed with angina.\n- Patients that have had an event in the past are being evaluated because they have experienced angina.\n- There are several risk factors identified in the evaluation of a patient who has recently had a heart attack. They could be:\n- Smoking 20 years ago\n- A family history of this disease by having a first heart attack at a young age, having had a prior heart attack, going through this treatment or not being treated, or a chronic condition (such as atrial fibrillation, heart valve disease, kidney failure, or diabetes) that predisposes to coronary artery disease due to obesity, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidaemia, or diabetes.\n- Other risk factors identified by the evaluation include;\n- Gender and race\n- Age; in fact, people are being evaluated in these age categories.\n- The type of medication the patient has taken to treat this condition is being discussed.\n- Physical exams and medical history screening is the important part of the heart risk assessment when assessing a patient with a risk/or risk/risk/risk/risk/risk. A person has been evaluated when they have a risk assessment and information is available that requires a change to the patient\u2019s medical plan. This evaluation should begin with a review of their medical and family history, and that may include other risk assessments identified by the evaluation. A comprehensive review of the patient\u2019s medical condition should include the following:\n- A complete evaluation of the coronary artery, the pulmonary arteries and the carotid arteries.\n- A general evaluation for the total body system including the kidneys, liver, thyroid, heart muscle, and the respiratory system.\n- The ability to determine the patient\u2019s family medical history and a history of other chronic illnesses such as diabetes.\nDuring a chest echocardiogram, a cardiologist will be able to determine if the patient\u2019s heart is in good condition for a heart attack.\n- During the evaluation of a patient, the staff discusses which type of medication they are being screened for, what the medications are, and the risks that are associated with the medications. The staff may also assist the patient with lifestyle modifications to prevent cardiovascular risk factors associated with heart disease.\n- Most people with chronic conditions have many other risk factors associated with this disease and this evaluation could also be included in the evaluation if a patient\u2019s health is not well-controlled on other cardiovascular risk factors.\n- For some people with atrial fibrillation, no other risk factor and a blood clot is the cause of the stroke, a chest x-ray with an echo may be needed for further evaluation.\n- Other types of chronic conditions include:\n- Heart failure\n- End-stage heart failure (failure to pump enough", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\n- A randomised controlled trial of 166 young smokers (15-26 years) from all smoking habit types enrolled into QALYs in five randomized clinical trials identified 123 adults with a first-degree relative (P340-P299) were given free nicotine replacement therapy on a tablet. All patients were followed for 25 months. After quitting, 34 (11) of 123 participants did not have CVD.\n- None of the 139 adults receiving an NICE guideline did it (P1206-P1636).\n- Only 2 of the 163 people in whom NICE guideline is recommended never have it in this respect.\nDoes NICE guideline advise against prescribing nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in all smokers (P340-P299) in terms of any CVD diagnosis or death during the study period?\n- NICE guideline recommends (P299) that for all people over 18 years old whose history of smoking is documented, NRT in the first four months of smoking cessation should be started in people having to quit smoking as a medical condition.\n- NICE guideline recommends that any person with a history of smoking or history of having a previous CVD diagnosis are NOT to be advised to take a NRT in the first six months of treatment, and that people who already have a CVD diagnosis are not to be advised to stop smoking.\n- NICE recommends that if someone has a particular CVD event and is receiving NRT, they should not be advised to stop smoking or continue to take a NRT.\nWhy is a NICE guideline saying a person can be cured or maintained for a long time with NRT?\n- NICE guideline says an individual who has been diagnosed with a non-communicable disease and has never smoked in the first four months of treatment, but is still advised to quit smoking, should not be recommended to take a NRT in those four months.\n- The guidelines strongly recommend for people to stop smoking or continue to take NRT to maintain CVD risk reduction through the first six months of treatment.\nWhy are people prescribed NRT only if they are NOT being recommended due to CVD risk?\n- People not taking a treatment are NOT advised to start taking NRT.\n- NRT (in the first four months of treatment)-> the treatment is only started if there is a high probability of the following (NHS guidelines).\n- People are advised to consider their CVD risk if they have these features during 3 months before starting a treatment (P340,P299-P510):\n- having a history of smoking or having a previous CVD diagnosis (P340 and P510)\n- having a previous 3-month cardiac event (P340-P421)\n- not taking a treatment (E394-E420)\n- having a history of smoking for the first year following treatment (P340-P349)\n- treatment interruption (not recommended to start therapy) (E394)\n- not taking a treatment after the year following smoking cessation is completed (E294-E535) or more than 15 years after quitting smoking (E299)\n- patients who are asked to consider starting therapy after 3 months, to be given NRT for 3 months (P340-P380)\n- patients who are asked 3-months to initiate therapy after 6 months (E394 and E501)\nIt is not clear for what reason a decision to start a treatment for a long time can be made but there are reasons why you should discontinue treatment after a maximum of three months.

A 29-year-old male who is 7 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 89 pounds will be considered a \u201cheight-independent\u201d risk factor because of his stature.

The presence of glucose in the urine does not distinguish between diabetes and CVD\n17. The following article is a peer-reviewed research article published in the December 2013 issue Of Science & Medicine. The author is Dr. Brian McCulloch and his Ph.D. research team at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth).\n18. This is from a 2018 study titled, \u201cDietary Factors and Cardiovascular Disease Prevention: Evidence of a Protective Effect on Coronary Artery Disease,\u201d published in the May 2018 issue of Circulation: Issue C2.\n19. This is from the 17 May 2019 edition of BMJ Case Report: A Case of Sudden Cardiac Arrest in a UK Patient: Diagnosis and Management. A 23-year-old woman presents to a general practitioner. The patient\u2019s medical history reveals a history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension which, along with cardiovascular abnormalities, has made the patient appear unrecognizable and therefore was not included in the assessment. After initial cardiac assessment and ECG, cardiac arrhythmias and conduction disturbances were identified immediately.\n20. As this article focuses on diabetes, the patient\u2019s condition was further complicated by her hypertension and diabetes, both of which are incommensurable metabolic disorders. The treatment for hyperlipidemia involves medication and the patient received therapy for hypertension. Blood pressure was then restored. The result was uncharacteristic rhythm, heart attack, and sudden death.\nThe authors\u2019 conclusions are:\n1. As with cardiovascular disease, diabetes is a global health problem.\n2. One of the most obvious factors for heart disease may be a lack of knowledge and education about risks, as diabetes is a metabolic disorder with the same underlying cause, \u201cinsulin dysfunction\u201d as with cardiovascular disease. A key component of diabetes prevention is lifestyle changes.\n3. Because diabetes increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, the risk factors for both CVD and diabetes should be considered. However, other risk factors such as hypertension have been overlooked in diabetes. These include high cholesterol and high blood pressure and are not incontrovertible markers for diabetes.\n4. If you\u2019re under 50, the doctor will suggest that if you don\u2019t already have diabetes, your blood pressure needs to be monitored regularly. The doctor may also suggest that you start a low-salt diet. If you have heart disease, you should also be started on a reduced-salt diet.\n5. Both type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolemia cause heart attacks and blood vessel damage. Patients who are under 50 should have a routine foot examination. Patients who already suffer from cardiovascular disease are at highest risk.\n6. Women with diabetes are at a higher risk of diabetes-related heart disease, and this increases the risk of cardiac arrest. Additionally, women with diabetes have been shown to pass 3rd degree family members to the next generation.\n7. A diabetes-predominant woman has a 2.3-fold greater risk of developing myocardial infarction (as seen in the patient below) as compared to one with diabetes who is a non-diabetic.\n8. Diabetes patients are 40 times more likely to develop hypertension (", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him? Why do we have to discuss this in their report?\nJENNIFER: As a general guideline, as with most health problems, your health care professional will have you meet with you and your doctor in order to assess your risk for CVD. This is usually done through a screening health program, including annual screenings of your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, blood glucose, blood pressure, and risk of myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, or other life threatening conditions. In this screening program, you will also be asked about your lifestyle habits and family history of CVD.\nThe most basic recommendations in the NICE guideline framework are as follows:\n\u2022 Stop smoking. Smoking is the single biggest cause of cardiovascular disease, and it is the fifth leading cause of death in Australia. In addition to lowering your risk of dying from CVD, smoking can raise your risk of developing conditions like cancer or lung cancer.\n\u2022 Maintain a healthy weight. Being underweight or overweight puts you at risk for some medical conditions including high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and stroke. To cut your risk for developing these conditions, aim to eat a healthy diet low in saturated fat and high in fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains and limit your excess weight by losing 5-7% of your body weight each week.\n\u2022 Control diabetes if you have it. If you have diabetes, your risk for developing coronary heart disease increases significantly. In addition to helping you prevent heart attacks, controlling your blood glucose helps your body function healthily.\n\u2022 Maintain your cholesterol levels. You can lower your risk for CVD by maintaining your HDL (good) cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL or \"bad\") cholesterol levels. You can also help your body metabolise cholesterol by making changes to your diet and exercise habits.\nAs discussed earlier in our Healthy Weight page, it's important to maintain a healthy weight and physical activity level as part of your overall lifestyle. You\u2019re part of your family's care team and can still choose to have a healthier lifestyle.\nWhat is Your Heart Risk?\nThe Heart is a major organ of the body, and it allows you to live by breathing and pumping blood into and out of the body via your arteries. To function properly, the heart must work as efficiently as it can. As we become older, these jobs do not happen as quickly and can be difficult. Your heart may become fatigued, and you may get sick less often and have fewer problems. The health of the heart and blood vessels is important for everyone and has implications for how we manage our life expectancy and our quality of health. A heart condition may cause some signs, like trouble walking, shortness of breath or chest pains, fatigue or weakness as well as cold feeling, and weakness or fatigue, chest pain and shortness of breath, that will require professional attention.\nHeart disease can affect any adult but is most common in people 45 and older and more often affects men. The risk of developing or dying from heart disease increases as we get older\u2014and it's often not even discovered until after you\u2019ve already suffered several heart attacks or strokes. Because this disease can be very difficult to diagnose early on, many people delay reaching a diagnosis and often end up losing their lives before seeing a doctor.\nHeart disease can be hereditary\u2014you or your parent could be predisposed to developing a heart condition if you, or someone in your family, have older age, has previously suffered heart attacks or strokes, or has a family history of heart disease. Research has shown that your chances of developing heart disease are higher if you have one of these factors in common with these people.\nPeople who have a family history or one risk factor for heart disease in these circumstances include:\n- A member of your immediate family members\n- A member of this family\n- A member of a first degree relative with one kind or variant of the CHD gene\n- An unrelated relative of any type or form of this condition\n- Any number of family members with the heart condition.\nHow Heart Disease Can Affect Other Areas of Life\nCertain risk factors can impact multiple aspects of one\u2019s life including\n- Mental health.\n- Family relationships.\n- Sexually active relationships.\n- Sleep. People with health problems often feel like they're alone in trying to deal with other people's feelings and problems.\nWhen we think about heart health or overall wellness, we tend to focus on the heart when people talk about good health. Research shows that not only can heart disease affect all parts of one\u2019s life, it can also affect another", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him? (Hint: this could be done by doing a self-assessment exercise on your own.) What is the NICE guideline for the population that should be targeted for CVD prevention?\nExercise (the risk factors included): The probability of a person having a heart attack is determined by the level of physical exercise. If a person follows a moderate exercise routine, their risk of having a heart attack is reduced by 8-fold. A 70-year-old Chinese man has an average heart rate of 150 beats per minute. His physical activities:\n- Walk briskly for 10 minutes three times a week.\n- Do housework twice a week for about eight hours.\n- Walk briskly for 40 minutes in three months.\nBMI is the weight in pounds divided by the height in meters squared, and is a measure of the percentage of body areas to the total body weight. A BMI of 25 or less reduces risk of heart attack by 10-15%, and a BMI of 27 or more increases risk by 22%.\nExcess weight \u2013 The likelihood of having a heart attack can be increased by weight gain if the BMI is higher than 27 or above 40 kg/m2. A woman with a weight of 170 lbs or more has a 10% greater risk of having a heart attack.\n- Blood pressure: The greater the blood pressure, the higher the chance of developing myocardial infarction or heart disease.\n- Blood cholesterol: The greater the blood cholesterol, the higher the risk of developing atherosclerosis or heart disease, and the greater the likelihood of developing heart attack or stroke.\n- HDL cholesterol: Higher HDL cholesterol concentrations reduce the risk of cardiovascular death\n- Smoking: Smoking increases the level of total cholesterol in the blood by 7-10%.\n- Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: Thickened arteries are more easily damaged and cause heart attack or stroke via blockage of blood vessels by plaque.\n- Diabetes mellitus: High blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, also called diabetic heart disease.\n- Obesity: Being overweight increases the risk of developing hypertension.\n- Family history of CVD: People with two or more close relatives with diabetes, heart disease, or stroke, should have a complete screening and risk assessment with the aim of preventing their future heart attack.\nExercise Guidelines on High Blood Pressure and Other Heart Disease\nThere is a great connection between weight gain and heart disease. If you are overweight or obese, high blood pressure or systolic high blood pressure will be higher and cause high blood pressure.\nThe NICE guideline outlines the benefits of 30 minutes of brisk walking or running on a regular basis for cardiovascular health:\n- Heart and circulation: Regular aerobic activity protects the heart and blood vessels, and controls blood pressure\n- General health: In people with high blood pressure, exercise improves blood flow and reduces your risk of heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure.\n- General well-being: This is linked with decreased mortality for people with low blood pressure.\n- Weight loss: A heart attack can often be avoided with weight loss.\nHow much exercise should be done each day?\n- There is not enough research to know precisely how much exercise is needed.\n- Generally, the advice is 15 to 20 minutes of moderate physical exercise per day.\n- Some low-energy calorie drinks contain little energy. Some people do not realize how many calories they are eating and adding it to their daily life.\n- It is important to have enough carbohydrates to sustain energy throughout the day. Carbohydrates are the second most important source of fuel.\n- Carbohydrate content varies between foods. Foods such as potatoes and breads generally contain less carbohydrates than grains.\n- A common suggestion for anyone interested in exercise is to follow a moderate exercise at least three times per week for 15 minutes, and then another exercise for a few minutes, three times per week.\n- A regular exercise programme should:\n- Improve physical fitness and make you feel more energetic.\n- Build lean muscle, making you look more toned, and increase libido as well.\n- Build bones (you should be at least 5-6 feet tall, as well as your bones are healthy and strong.)\n- Improve overall quality of life by reducing the risk of disease, improving mood, improving sleep, and improving mental health.\nThe amount of moderate exercise you do is determined by your body weight and activity tolerance. For example, a person who weighs ", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\nThe NICE guidelines recommend lifestyle interventions for people aged 40 years and older with type 2 diabetes and at least moderate risk of heart disease.\nThese guidelines suggest that lifestyle interventions should be offered to most people aged 40 years and older, regardless of their risk factors, with a goal of delaying or preventing type 2 diabetes progression and complications.\nIn a recent analysis of the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for people aged 40-74 years, there were only 22 recommendations from the guideline-based models for CVD. Only 1 was for lifestyle measures to be included in a group of people with a high or moderate-risk category. For most of the people in this group, the risk for developing a CVD was low and most would be able to make a lifestyle change without needing treatment.\nThe overall group of people without CVD in the NICE guidelines was low, but the overall group of people with CVD was increasing.\nAccording to these recommendations, the most important lifestyle modifications to include in any of the lifestyle measures include:\n- Lose weight and maintain a healthy weight\n- Exercise regularly\n- Control blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose\n- Quit smoking\n- Cut down on alcohol and unhealthy foods, and limit sodium and increase fruit and vegetable intake\n- Lower your cholesterol, improve your HDL, and keep your blood pressure under management\n- Stop taking medications like metformin\nThe NICE guidelines should be updated with such information as more people are living with diabetes and lifestyle changes for people with diabetes, including healthy meals and sufficient exercise, seem helpful.\nWe don\u2019t want to over-emphasize that more people need to be advised or encouraged to exercise to support their risk for CVD.\nLifestyle strategies that can help reduce risk of developing CVD include:\n- Regular physical activity\n- Healthy eating\n- Smoking cessation\n- Weight management\nIt\u2019s important to remember how often your diet and lifestyle can influence your health. The NICE guidelines suggest that the number of servings of fruits and vegetables you eat each day equals the daily energy intake in your diet.\nEating a diet that includes healthy fats, including nuts, avocados, fatty fish, and olive oil, as well as complex carbohydrates are also important.\nThe following items also play an important role in preventing CVD:\n- Lowering your blood glucose levels\n- Exercise more each day\n- Eating less processed food\n- Reducing your salt intake, and avoiding alcoholic beverages and salt-preserved foods", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\n2.

This includes avoiding smoking, drinking moderately as well as eating a well-balanced diet. The NICE DynaMed guidelines suggest that weight loss should be treated for hypertension. If you are diagnosed with elevated blood pressure, your primary care or specialist may monitor your blood pressure. For individuals with chronic hypertension who already have symptoms of increased blood pressure, screening for the condition at regular health visits could improve the diagnosis and treatment options.\nAccording to an article published in the journal British Medical Journal, dietary lipids, especially those derived from saturated fat, can cause vascular damage to the blood vessels in your body. Even if there is no evidence that saturated fats directly cause high blood pressure, it is still advised to include them in your daily diet with every meal. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fatty fish, are recommended to lower cholesterol and reduce blood pressure levels, while omega-6 fatty acids from safflower oil and sunflower oil are recommended to help your blood vessels function properly.\nCardiovascular or heart disease is caused by a number of factors. These include, among other risk factors, smoking, diabetes, cholesterol, blood pressure and high cholesterol. Lifestyle changes, weight loss, diet, control of other risk factors, treatment and management are all vital in maintaining a healthy heart.\nDietary intake (as determined by personal standards) varies substantially from one population group or individual to another although the general pattern is one of increased consumption of fresh, unprocessed plant foods, especially of those predominantly produced from or milled from grains (at least half your plate), legumes (dried peas and beans), and few added sugars, saturated fats, trans fat, or sodium. Most of a person's dietary carbohydrate intake should come from sources that provide an equivalent of one carbohydrate for every three calories in the diet. Ideal carbohydrates include starchy vegetables (like potatoes), berries, and nonrefined grains such as whole-wheat couscous, whole-wheat bread, and brown rice. Good fats include polyunsaturated fats from omega-3 fatty acids (Tofu & Green leafy vegetables) and monounsaturated fats (oily fish).\nSome cardiovascular risk factors, such as excess body weight or high blood pressure, are modifiable (that is, lifestyle) and therefore can be modified (e.g., increased physical activity), while others (including diabetes and smoking) cannot be changed and have a genetic component (34, 35). The most important modifiable factors related to cardiovascular disease are diet and body weight, which each have modifiable risk factors (33). In the study in women, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, and tobacco use were found to be modifiable risk factors (regardless from diet and weight). Thus a balanced mix of approaches can improve adherence to cardiovascular health guidelines.\nThe results are promising, but there is still much more work to be done to ensure the safety and efficacy of these types of medications. The FDA is working with pharmaceutical companies and a committee responsible for risk assessment to review both the current regulatory policies surrounding antihypertensive medications, including their proper safety and compliance with labeling and labeling procedures, as well as the appropriate risk-benefit profile for these medications that would prevent unwanted side effects. However, the results in the published studies have not been as positive as the ones previously published in this review. As such, it is likely that as more new medications are approved, they will undergo further evaluation by the FDA. Only time will tell which conclusions can be made from the findings of these studies, as are the new results from our ongoing investigation of the drug-induced cardiomyopathy, NIAID funded study 159422, and other studies conducted in our lab and in animal models.\nAccording to the American Heart Association, dietary cholesterol is neither required nor necessary for those having healthy cholesterol levels. It is best to avoid cholesterol-rich foods, and limit saturated fats such as butter, coconut oil, and eggs when consuming a diet rich in plant-based fats.\nIn my practice I\u2019ve seen in many cases that patients who are at high risk of CVD are also at risk for diabetes, or for type II diabetes. For patients who are diagnosed with these conditions, there is always a risk of CVD related complications because these patients may already have elevated blood pressure or high cholesterol levels.\nA recent study by the University of Colorado School of Medicine evaluated the effect of a sodium-lowering dietary treatment on vascular function in patients with hypertension.

The next step is to identify what levels of risk in the future and to start controlling and controlling the risk.\nIn the case of John, there are risks that need to be considered to lower risk. The most important factors to be considered are risk factors for hypertension and diabetes, which can be controlled by eating healthy, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and controlling blood cholesterol. As for smoking, there are also key risk factors to be considered in relation to heart disease and lung diseases, which can be controlled by not smoking, and the quitting of tobacco products. Lifestyle factors such as stress and unhealthy food habits should also be considered, and the way to deal with these should be taken care of.\nBased on the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention, which are the \u201csustainable preventive action\u201d guidelines from the Australian Preventative Task Force, the next steps are to develop and improve these guidelines to determine the best ways to prevent CVD in the future and to set up a national strategy to guide individuals and families in lifestyle change in order for risk factors to be controlled and controlled. As we know, with this new age people, with new knowledge and information, we need to work hard to raise awareness and understanding on the importance of lifestyle changes.\nAll in all, the NICE guidelines for prevention of all risk factors for CVD have a great impact and importance for this society to protect its health.\nJohn S. F. is a graduate student at the Faculty of Health Sciences, and the Director of the School for Health Promotion. He is interested in health promotion and preventive sciences.\nHow did I identify my lifestyle factors and what can prevent these factors?\nMy lifestyle habits include healthy food, exercise, and smoking. My knowledge about my lifestyle is collected from a range of sources including friends and social media, which include the World Health Organization\u2019s International Health Conference and the European Medical News.\nWhat was your research on the impact of the NICE guidelines on prevention of CVD?\nWe looked at the changes of heart disease in the Australian population. According to the NICE guidelines, a healthy lifestyle would lower the risk of heart disease in one year in the future. To improve it, we will work with a group consisting of different people to have a series of questions to ask about their lifestyle habits and develop strategies and programmes on what to change or how to change them. This will provide a basis for our recommendations and their implementation.\nHow are the recommendations for people to change life?\nHealthy eating and physical activity are the first priority. Eating a balanced diet with fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes is important for maintaining good health. Furthermore, regular and moderate physical activity is important for maintaining good health. Exercising regularly is important, but so is rest and the ability to sleep. To reach a healthy weight, a person should maintain a body weight that is within their abilities, have the healthy habits they are using, and eat a balanced diet. Smoking and using other harmful products should be avoided. The prevention of CVD is done for good health, and lifestyle changes are effective tools for achieving better health.\nWhat is the NICE report called? It basically contains recommendations for lifestyle changes, and I really appreciate this publication. In addition, I often listen in the radio, and I try to find what health topics are covered in the most recent reports. Please refer to the NICE guideline and the WHO document I mentioned in this article, which includes the NICE guidelines for lifestyle factors.\nWhat were your results for the changes in heart disease risk in the future in your research?\nIn the future, there will be many other changes.\nWhat are the recommendations in this document?

However, some people can reach or exceed the threshold when not exercising enough and/or eating poorly, meaning it is not a risk factor and is actually a health problem.\nHow many points can you give the NHS for smoking at any point in your life?\nAs with any medication, there is a threshold value that you need to consider in order to achieve the NHS recommendation. The highest possible value and the lowest possible point can, in the absence of exercise, be:\nTo maintain a healthy weight, smoking cessation, and even low cholesterol can be difficult, so only if you are not smoking can these points be considered. The following guidelines can also be used for this purpose.\n- Age: You should never smoke around your 20s so this does not apply\n- Your age is the highest potential point of your lifetime\n- Cigarette smoke is more than 1 pack per day if you are 20 or 30 years old.\n- Cigarette smoke has an absolute maximum of 2 pack a day for 40 years and beyond\n- Smokers with high LDL levels and/or blood pressure, who have smoked for 20 years or more, are considered high.\n- Smoking during adolescence is considered high.\n- Smoking 1 pack a day for the first 40 years of your life, even if you smoke now is considered high\nThere are many other points that are beyond the reach and need to be considered as the individual has an individual health risk, for different stages of his or her life. For example, if he has the following as a risk point:\n- The doctor prescribes drugs to help control cholesterol, such as statins, which can be problematic for many people.\n- He has also developed coronary artery disease, which is a risk factor for death, as shown by the BMI of 30.\n- The doctor also advises the patient to check his blood pressure, so there is a chance that he has high blood pressure that has not been detected.\nOther points are:\n- Lack of exercise as a risk factor: not exercising enough and/or eating poorly\n- Poor diet and food choices: these are poor for the body\n- Sedentary lifestyle: physically inactive.\n- Tobacco, which is the only risk factor associated with CAD, according to the guidelines: for 35 years of age and up, smoking is considered high, if you continue to smoke.\n- High levels of both HDL cholesterol and blood pressure.\n- Physical inactivity is more important than smoking because, as you exercise, more blood will flow through his arteries, which means it is more likely to have a blood clot in his arteries. Blood clots are extremely dangerous, so they clog your blood vessels, and when they get close to your heart, they can cause a heart attack or sudden death."], "3": ["Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\n- [T) A.E.

At present, these are not adequate in most countries, but the current trends suggest that the current treatment and management of cardiovascular risk factors is inadequate. It is imperative to strengthen preventive cardiology to prevent myocardial infarction and heart disease.\nA high degree of risk of hypertension is associated with the development of atherosclerosis from the carotid arteries and the formation of blood clots in the aortic arch is associated with arterial atherosclerosis. In addition, the coronary angiogram with the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) has been shown to show the potential in the prevention of arterial heart disease and a reduction in the incidence of atherosclerotic heart disease. Atherosclerotic lesions of the heart are associated with hypertension. Hypertension may be associated with atherosclerosis and the development of heart disease due to its relationship with other risk factors. A high degree of risk for heart disease could be prevented by the use of a hypertension or blood pressure control, by taking a low-dose aspirin and/or statin drugs and by controlling blood sugar, triglycerides and cholesterol.", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\nJohn\u2019s Cardiovascular Management Program (CVMP) should include a cardiopulmonary risk assessment (CPR) to calculate the cardiovascular risk factor burden 24 hours after discharge from the hospital. The primary goal of the CCVMP is to identify potential risk factors that could be amenable to treatment. \nThe findings of this randomized, open-label, cross-sectional study suggest a 20% overall reduction in the burden of CVD and significant reductions in the number of comorbidities associated with coronary artery disease. This study can be confirmed by additional research evaluating the efficacy of this intervention in other high-risk hospitalized patients.\nHow is a Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Program for Hospitalized Elderly Patients Managed?\nAs the aging population continues to increase, this will be an even more pressing issue for patients in the hospital. A heart-healthy lifestyle program for patient hospitalized patients would be an integral part of the health care provided by the hospital, and a part of the care delivered to the patient and to the interdisciplinary team members involved. The program can have two goals: to:\n- Reduce mortality rates of high-risk patients and\n- Reduce the burden for hospitalized patients of comorbidities and cardiovascular morbidity.\nThe primary outcome variable would be the duration of hospitalization.\nPrimary Outcomes: Mortality\nSince the 1990s, a growing number of guidelines have been published from large-scale studies looking at the association between mortality and different determinants. The literature reveals that these studies focus on people who are elderly but are not clearly defined. The most recent studies reported at least three different trends in mortality, with a strong focus on younger patients. The current approach to defining and differentiating characteristics is based on a large observational cohort of hospitalized elderly patients. This approach allows for comparisons of older hospitalized patients with their similar populations at other hospitals.\nIn the last few years, the most widely used definitions for hospitalized elderly patients, in terms of mortality risks and predictors of mortality, have been developed through the World Health Organization (WHO). These definitions focus on age (15-69 years), cardiovascular disease (including those with a history of a heart attack or stroke), and diabetes. All of these variables need to be considered when considering the risk stratification for the different subsets of hospitalized elderly patients who are at highest risk for mortality.\nThe outcomes of interest for every group are cardiovascular risk factors while the age group at risk is also an important consideration since as people get older they are at risk for a larger number of comorbidities. There are several key risk factors for hospital-acquired cardiovascular death including increased systolic pressure with age 200 mmHg (73%), coronary artery disease with age 150 mmHg (133%), and diabetes with age 109% (140%). This may be the case if the individual had one or more of the following risk factors: hypertension, hyperlipidemia, central obesity or a family history.\nThe major risk factor for admission to the intensive care unit is increased hypertension, which is usually due to multiple causes such as kidney disease, previous heart attack, congestive heart failure and diabetes.  Other risk factors are a history of acute illness, cancer, stroke or heart attack with one or more other risk factors including obesity, depression, smoking, atrial fibrillation or chronic kidney disease. \nThe risk for hospitalization is increased when the patient enters the hospital. The two main risk factors related to the hospital include a history of pneumonia with multiple other conditions including acute respiratory infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes or chronic kidney disease.  Other conditions that are associated with hospitalization are:\n- cancer with multiple other characteristics: kidney disease, prostate cancer or lymphoma- any of the cancer subtypes of leukemia and/or lymphoma\n- anemia or iron deficiency anaemia\n- cardiovascular disease \n- diabetes \nThis last disease category includes diabetes that is poorly controlled (e.g. uncontrolled hemoglobin A1c), diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease and chronic kidney disease.\nThe World Health Organization defines diabetes mellitus as a major adverse metabolic syndrome associated with diabetes, high blood glucose levels, and low levels of blood lipids.  This model may be appropriate for the patients in the hospital who suffer from hypertension, diabetes or dyslipidemia since these are the major risk factors for hospitalization.\nA 2019 meta-analysis published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) found that treatment for diabetes or hyperlipidemic patients in hospital had a better outcome compared to the general patient. This implies that individuals with more severe cardiopulmonary diseases", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\nA2B8: 2:07 AM\n2:13 AM\n00C8273C0C000000.jpg\n08:36 AM\nHISTORY\nFirst visit:\nJan-Apr, 2019\n70.0 (15)\n\nDr. Lv was the first one; he started working there in January 2019.\n\nOn the first visit, I had this list of symptoms \u2014 a high blood pressure and irregular heartbeat. The heart just did not work like it should have \u2014 the valves in the heart don\u2019t properly pump blood. My doctor said not to worry, I just had an infection in my chest from smoking. Then, we were able to diagnose it as a congenital heart defect. Dr. Lv now needs to be evaluated for a variety of conditions that could be causing this, and I\u2019d love to know what those conditions are. Thanks in advance.\nI\u2019m 63 years old and have lived for a year, 40 months, and 3 days of the virus. I don\u2019t know which one. I don\u2019t know where you found these symptoms, I just have them.\n\nThe most notable thing is: I did not feel really sick (not with chest pain and shortness of breath) because I\u2019m a pretty good person. My doctor had told me that I could have any of the problems I listed.\n\nI have been to 7 of the 10 emergency rooms since December. My doctor said it should be obvious it was my heart, so it was. I just didn\u2019t want to know until I went to my PCP.\nThis physician did not know what I could\u2019ve done and it was never corrected.\n\nHe called my last doctor (my doctor because 6 months before), who was worried about my heart, but said it was a benign problem.\nSince I never told him the actual problem, my doctor went from treating him as if he was a real doctor to a medical specialist.\nI should have known I needed to have a heart surgery (I am too old) but they ignored it, and have had no answers, without warning.\n\nI was finally called to his office for the heart surgery later on June 27th, 2020. I had chest pain and a sore throat. He didn\u2019t tell me the reason for this, which was due to not eating regularly. Once he had enough guts for it, I started eating two more meals a day, but that didn\u2019t give me much nutritional benefit (too quick to start and not giving any benefit at all). I\u2019m 66, and have been through the menopause I didn\u2019t know I was having the problem, as I said. I was told it would be the end of my health. I had to have this surgery (the doctors said taking the pills would be the least of my problems) but they refused. I\u2019m very worried they won\u2019t do it for me, and I think we\u2019ve hit an obstacle with this procedure. All they said was you have to take a pill for 6 days, and the pills don\u2019t work for me.\nI ended up being on a medication that didn\u2019t help, but they said it was not worth the hassle. I was told I had to give up everything I had on medicine to go for the surgery, but they gave me a prescription for heart surgery with only one drop of blood. There was nothing I needed to take, and they just gave me my favorite fruit juice. The first side effect I had was a severe drop in blood sugar. Even after that and after the 6-day course of medicine, I had no power to do anything. I had to drink 4 cups of milk and that wasn\u2019t healthy for an 80 year old. I did the best I could, but I felt like it was the end of myself and that I had to die. It was like a death poem to me.\n\nI have lost to years, but not this horrible pain because I had my own little miracle, one of the most important organs in our body, which we\u2019re not even aware of because we don\u2019t know what it is, that is the heart.

His risk factors are explained in detail in \u201cRisk stratification in individuals with a high risk of cardiovascular disease\u201d.\nJohn is a candidate for a glucose tolerance test (GT). His HbA1c should be 6.5% or more and he should undergo an ECG in line with the guideline for the use of glucose after meals and be monitored for an ambulatory glucose-monitoring test (AGM\u2013ARB). At the time of the study, he is in the category GP-A-G: he shows no risk factors other than the high risk of diabetes (Table 2).\nFigure 3. An example of the ECG, with red arrows showing the frequency and depth of the waves, and an image of the AGM-ARB in the ECG strip (the values of which are the values of the ECG on the left and left side of the graph, respectively, shown).\nAfter two months of following guidelines with diet, exercise, pharmacological therapy and medication, John achieved a GTT of 7.2 mmol/L after 7 consecutive days. His glucose-tolerance test for glucose after meals was normal. At this point, the ECG readings and all other factors are shown in Figure 4.\nFigure 4. An example of the ECG, with red arrows showing the frequency and depth of the waves, and an image of the AGM-ARB in the ECG strip (the values of which are the values of the ECG on the left and on the left of the graph, respectively, shown).\nAfter 3 years, all the factors were normal. However, John has an AGM-ARB value below 6.5%. A second AGM-ARB reading should be taken to evaluate the possibility of progression to type 2 diabetes (Table 3A).\nTable 2. HbA1c guidelines (12-30 mmol/mol)\nThe table shows guidelines for HbA1c among patients with a high risk of diabetes, and includes recommendations on the use of AGM-ARBs for diagnosis and follow-up of the patient.\nThe diagnosis and treatment of type 2 diabetes is based on three measures. For individuals with prediabetes, all three measures should be high. For those with mild fasting blood glucose (BFGM):\n- A2C: A2C is defined as the proportion of HbA1c below 6.12 mmol/mol.\n- fasting blood glucose: fasting blood glucose less than 80 mg/dl and more than 99 mg/dl on 2 different occasions (the reference above).\n- oral glucose tolerance test:\n- postprandial glucose tolerance test: is the result of 5 hours of fasting and 90 min of eating a 3% glucose syrup, is divided by 2.\n- \u00bd glucose: 250 minutes before the test (1.3 glucose is administered prior to the test).\n- glucose tolerance test: is a 12-hour test after the first 4 hours of fasting to determine the postprandial glucose tolerance test.\n- 2 glucose glucose: 250 minutes after the test.\n- 2 glucose: 2 min before the test.\nIn individuals with prediabetes, the AGM-ARB should also be within the range of the normal reference value. Those with stage 1-2 diabetes may be prescribed one AGM-ARB: once daily, once daily for adults, and once daily for children under 12 years.\nIndividuals with glucose intolerance or dysglycemia (the AGM-ARB may not be within the low, neutral or hyperglycemic range) should be treated once daily, whereas those with hyperglycemia should be treated twice daily. If the AGM-ARB is within the high range, then it should be kept on day 12", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\nWhat about John, is he on ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers?\nWhich are the most appropriate, effective, and safe medications for John?\nThe answer to all these questions depends on each patient's circumstances. Generally speaking, blood-pressure reduction below 130/80 mm Hg is a safe goal. A blood pressure below 119/61 mm Hg is not, since this can lead to a higher pulse pressure and cardiovascular events. A systolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg is in the safe range. When a target blood pressure is achieved, hypertension can be brought under control with lifestyle modifications. If not, the patient is likely to need antihypertensive medications.\nYour patient is a 70-year-old and has a high-cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking history, so the guidelines don't consider all of these factors. The guidelines consider each of these variables separately, then combine them into the category of CVD risk.

His cholesterol and triglyceride levels were normal, and he has good cardiovascular health. His blood pressure was also elevated.\nHis cholesterol and triglycerides were high. His blood pressure was at or above a \"normal\" level. His glucose and cholesterol values were normal, while his weight and waist were abnormal. His HDL was borderline high.

In addition, he has normal lipids (non-HDL - high cholesterol) and high levels of endothelial function.\nWhat are the lifestyle recommendations for John?\nJohn should have the following recommendations:\n1. Take a daily aspirin, given daily to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by 80% (725 mg/day daily for 6 months)\n2. Continue with the diet you have chosen (modify the food intake according to the plan as per your doctor's recommendation).\n3. Take one of the following medications (no need to change the drugs prescribed by your doctor.) For myocardial infarction:\nCholesterol-lowering medications such as statins can reduce the risk of heart attacks and deaths. Chondroprotection medications can counteract the effects of atherosclerosis in the future.\nCardiovascular disease is an umbrella term for any illnesses that influence the heart and blood vessels. There are many people (e.g. children, older adults), groups, people (e.g. women, men) and communities associated with a potential of cardiovascular disease. Heart disease and stroke are the major concern in these groups and include things such as diabetes, heart attack, vascular calcifications seen on blood tests, coronary artery disease, ischemic heart disease, and atherosclerosis, which involves deposits of cholesterol crystals within the artery walls.\nSuffice it to say that cardiovascular diseases affect the millions of people globally and account for 1.82 million deaths in 2010.", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\nAnswer: If you are a man who has recently lost all your weight, your blood pressure should be in the 130-169 mmHg range and your HDL level should be under 30 mg/dL. If you are a man who currently has a family history of CVD (high family history), your blood pressure should be 140/90 mmHg or 101 mmHg and your HDL level should be under 40 mg/dL. Your triglycerides should be at a healthy level of 250/150 mg/dL.\nFor women, the following guidelines can be made for John, a non-smoker with a BMI of 30, total cholesterol of 5.3 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.5 mmol/L, and a family history of CVD.\n- If you have recently lost your weight. A 20% weight loss of 5% kg is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to achieve an appropriate BMI and drop systolic cholesterol through 25% of your HDL level. If you have a family history of CVD, the reduction of triglycerides will be even more necessary for a weight loss of 20% of your HDL level.\n- If you have coronary heart disease. A 30% weight loss of 5% 6% kg is recommended for coronary heart disease.\n- If you have a family history of CVD. A 40% weight loss reduction by 10% of your HDL level is recommended through 25%.\n- If your triglycerides are elevated (>150 mg/dL). Weight loss of 3% kg from your total cholesterol by 25% is the recommended target.\n- If your total cholesterol is elevated (250 mg/dL.) Weight loss of 2% kg from your total cholesterol by 25% is the recommended target.\n- If your HDL levels are elevated (100-150 mg/dL.) weight loss of 2% kg from your HDL levels by 25% is the recommended target.\nThe following guidelines can be made for John, a non-smoker who has been a smoker for 50 years, without co-existing diseases.\n- A 70% weight loss of 5% kg is suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) that can be made by a reduction in triglycerides of 35%. If a person has co-existing diseases that cause atherosclerosis, the reduction can be improved by 5%. If a person with coronary artery disease has been diagnosed, the reduction can be improved by 5%.\n- If you are a 35 years old male who has lost 10 kg since your last check up. You start your weight loss by losing 10%, and then increase your daily caloric intake by 20%, then gradually reduce your calorie intake to 15% until your fat and protein calories are reached. If your HDL level is 150 mg/dL, your weight loss is still required. With your body fat percentage being around 18-20%, then you need 100. Your triglyceride level is also lower, so your weight gain is not so much more than that of an adult male. Once you reach your optimal amount of fats, you can continue reducing calories significantly until your body fat percentage becomes 14%.\n- Loss from 25% to 30 percent of your triglyceride levels is necessary. Because of the decrease in your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level, you can increase your HDL level by 18% and maintain your normal weight. If you have been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease or other risk factors for heart disease, you will need to reduce your cholesterol levels to less than 150 mg/dl. If you have a family history of clogged arteries, your weight should go back to the 70% weight goal. If you have been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease or your cholesterol is above 30, you should continue reducing calories, since your body fat percentage continues to increase.\n- Loss of 30% through 10% of your HDL level is necessary. After losing weight, you can reduce your LDL cholesterol level by 15% or more, and maintain your normal weight. Because your liver can process more of the bile acids, you will be able to reduce your LDL cholesterol by a higher number of fat calories.", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\n1. John has a BMI of 30 \u2013 and is a recent smoker and a history of myocardial infarction. His heart has stiffened and does not refill with blood in the middle \u2013 he suffers from peripheral arterial disease \u2013 both of which are associated with a cardiac arrest.\n2. I have discussed with John\u2019s family, his blood cholesterol numbers, total and HDL cholesterol. John may have to make drastic lifestyle changes. These are not easy for John, but for his own health, as well as the heart, to make it happen. John has been inactive for most of his life and has a sedentary work job and family lifestyle that may leave the cardiovascular risk genes open. It would seem John\u2019s heart has taken over and he may need a little help and may be helped to do this by drugs (usually done with blood thinners). John has been on statins \u2013 such as the drug Lipoxin \u2013 for years and has been advised to stop \u2013 that in fact those medicines make him vulnerable to coronary artery disease as well, so all medication taken must be closely watched. John has also taken aspirin \u2013 it\u2019s been said to protect against heart attack. But that is a long time ago. John has been told to be active and eat healthy. John may be able to move, train, or be put on exercise equipment in and outside the home to get an exercise regime. He can move, train if he wishes. John\u2019s exercise regimen may be a little strenuous so he can talk and understand, but a good program has to include cardio, strength training and weight lifting. I would think that John should talk to his doctor first before moving on to more physical exercise.\n\u201cThere are multiple points of discussion of the NICE guidelines, which is quite a long document, and there is a very important information that is missing\u2026[and that is] the information on the \u2018prevention.\u2019 One may see that many people don\u2019t take the prevention as a whole. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t know that people should exercise a lot, or try to lose weight. So it\u2019s important that you explain it clearly\u2026It\u2019s a very large deal, you get 20, 30 minutes spent every day exercising. What people aren\u2019t aware of is that 70-80% of the population isn\u2019t active. All the time in the day if it\u2019s 8 o\u2019clock a.m. or 8 o\u2019clock p.m. It\u2019s really 9 o\u2019clock or 9 o\u2019clock, and there\u2019s the 9 o\u2019clock time that it\u2019s supposed to take away. Then there\u2019s the time you can\u2019t make that effort, either because of sleep, or work.\u201d\n-John\u2019s Doctor, John Hao\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t take the prevention into the context or into context of their exercise routine. They are trying to be active. They are trying to be more active or they are trying to be more energetic or active, but the question is why are they doing it? If you have the same lifestyle, you do what all the people all the time have said are true, it\u2019s not because they are doing it correctly. They were just doing it to avoid the consequences from doing it that were already present. If you want to build a heart, you don\u2019t want to build an artery. Just to get people to do their exercise, you have to do what a lot of people, I know, I\u2019ve seen, are doing, they are doing, but it\u2019s a very important message and a very important message as well.\u201d\n-John Hao, NICE Guidelines Expert\n\u201cPeople take exercise as part of their health care for health. They take exercise part of their day. But I think it doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ve been exercising as a group. They should be exercising as a group and not just in the moment, or right before bed. People can actually do it and lose weight, and they can keep it up all day as a routine part of their health care.\u201d\n-Thomas A. Tromp (Professor, University of Pittsburgh Medical School), NICE Guideline Expert\n\u201cAlthough the discussion will continue to focus on the \u2018prevention\u2019 it\u2019s not because of the \u2018prevention\u2019 or the \u2018prevention\u2019 that is discussed.

In your expert opinion, they are based on randomised controlled trials, and no other type of clinical trials has been done so far to show that those interventions reduce or prevent CVD.\nThe NICE report is a standard of care and is the authoritative voice of the expert committee that developed it.\nIn the case of John\u2019s heart, we are not expecting a response to the NICE recommendations from John\u2019s cardiologist, so we ask for more data on his heart and hypertension from the hospital doctors who are familiar with him, and I am sure they think this is a good idea.\nIf this is the case, then we can assume that John has cardiovascular treatment and the recommendation is to start his treatment as soon as possible. This would be the case if John has 10-20 sessions of high-risk heart treatment before he falls and is able to take his prescriptions.\nThe advice should start right away. If John cannot take any of the prescribed instructions right away, the advice would be to start at the most important appointment.\nJohn\u2019s hypertension:\nIt\u2019s important to mention that your own opinion alone will not be enough.

Carbohydrates are an important source of energy because they provide glucose, but their role is secondary to fat and protein. This allows for the maintenance of muscle mass, but it does not provide the energy needed to maintain normal functions.\u201d\nFardat Al Mubarak emphasizes that the patient should balance carbohydrates and protein.\nShe recommends an exercise with 100 \u2013 120 minutes per week of vigorous exercise with moderate-intensity activity.\nHere are some tips to help keep your blood pressure and lipids in check while maintaining a healthy weight:\n1.

However, one of the biggest concerns has been that the number of people affected is increasing, as well as the number of hospitals. It is obvious that the coronavirus will hit hard during this pandemic and with that, you might be wondering: \u201cHow will my cholesterol levels and hypertension relate to COVID-19 and COVID 19-related risks?\u201d\nIt is quite easy to answer that since the coronavirus is transmitted by respiratory droplets, there is a very high chance that the symptoms of coronavirus will be transmitted to people, mostly, via droplets. If I understand this correctly, by increasing the level of cholesterol and blood pressure, it is possible that there will be a change in your heart rate and blood pressure, it is a risk of some complications. This could therefore indicate that your cholesterol level has increased.\nYour cholesterol level will also increase due to stress, you might decide to avoid sugary or fatty foods, and you might also add fish like salmon, mackerel and sardines.\nHow can that affect your LDL and HDL levels?\nWhen you eat a lot and are very stressed, for example, it is better to choose foods that improve your cholesterol level and increase HDL, and fatty acid-rich foods such as fish can be better for your cholesterol level.\nAnother way of reducing your cholesterol when your health is at its best is to reduce your cholesterol. This would not be the best plan in all of these cases, but it is the best in terms of your cholesterol. The only thing that must be done for LDL is to stay away from any kind of cholesterol-rich food as it will lower your HDL and HDL and thereby improve your LDL.\nAt 10-20 percent, you might notice your cholesterol gradually decreases, but there are several other ways of reducing your cholesterol and your LDL and HDL. For example, you can reduce your calories by keeping your body weight in the correct ratio of BMI to body weight.

The DASH diet was inspired by the high-protein foods that the American heart association recommends for people whose blood pressure is well managed, and the high-fiber foods that suggest a more gentle and comprehensive approach to nutrition.\nA comprehensive approach to the DASH food guidelines addresses the following:\n- Total amount of Kcal available from protein, dietary fat, and starches\n- Kcal present per 100 grams of total carbohydrate intake\n- Kcal present per 100 grams of dietary fiber\n- Dietary calories expended per day\nSince 1995, in the US, dietary guidelines are no longer being published\nThe most recent edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, released in December 2005, did not include food standards. As a result, the Dietary Guidelines were not updated, resulting in a more comprehensive approach.

He should also incorporate healthy monounsaturated fats such as avocados and olive oil into the diet, along with nuts and fatty fish.\nHow can John reduce the risk of CVD by eating more fruits, vegetables and nuts?\nThere is a link between the amount of fish eaten and the risk of CVD. Aim for at least 2 2 5g of fish per week. For example, a child or teen can eat 2 x 5g of fish per week on average. For children under 5 years, adults under 43 and people over 54 years of age, it should be 2 x 75g per week, to achieve optimal intake. A fish like salmon is even more appropriate in the early years as it has a very high mercury content, which has a negative impact on heart health. In this case, a two x 5g portion of salmon (a small fish) can be eaten weekly, just about every day. The recommended intake for men is 55g for men and 64g for women per day. Both men and women should eat at least 2x as much as possible fish, as fish is an important part of a healthy diet!\nChildren and young people?\nThe recommended intake for children and young people is 1/3 or perhaps more of their diet.

For example, if there are 4 vegetables in the lunch box to go along with one fruit it will be necessary to increase the quantity or you will not be able to offer one of the \u2018goodies\u2019.\nFor children under 10 years of age, we\u2019d recommend a minimum intake of at least 5.5 servings of fruit and vegetables every day \u2013 a 75g fruit or vegetables for a 10kg child (3,750g, or approximately 2,020 g).

If we know and look for 'non-random screening' strategies, such as counselling and health awareness campaigns; we should be able to answer these questions.\n1.What is the current evidence that CVD risk reduction, by simple interventions, can reduce the progression to cardiovascular disease/disabling illnesses?\nThe Cochrane reviews 2008-May 5 summarise 6 randomised controlled trials evaluating 15 non-standardised CHD risk reduction interventions. The pooled results reported that although both the interventions were associated with reducing blood pressure, the interventions did not significantly reduce BMI, blood pressure (hypertensive or otherwise), smoking duration or blood lipids. The main adverse effects of the interventions were seen at the lowest level of BP, even at a moderate level. Interventions should be assessed in detail to identify the most suitable interventions, particularly those that are likely to have the best potential for short-term (e.g. within a few weeks of the intervention), or longer term (>months) effects. It was observed that both of the interventions resulted in an additional benefit of reducing the number of episodes of CVD. Other important outcomes might include improving quality of life, general fitness and lowering blood pressure.\n2.What are the associated side effects and mechanisms of action\nOne reason for the inconsistent findings with the different interventions is the absence of standardised data on adverse effects. Studies reporting a positive effect show more adverse effects than if there is one good example; such as that of an improvement in blood pressure with a 70-year-old smoker. The effect of anti-nociceptive agents and anticoagulants, are likely to be associated with adverse short-term effects, while the effects on low-density lipids may possibly be related to the adverse effects on vascular tone.\n3. Is there evidence that a 'low intensity' intervention (e.g. counselling, training) has equivalent to a 'low intensity' intervention? (e.g. screening with a blood pressure chart, or using a TAA app on mobile phones)\nNo evidence was found to indicate that an equivalent intervention in patients would be of a similar quality to that already known to have had an intervention effect on the number of episodes of a CVD-suspected event (e.g. heart attack or stroke).\n4.Does the evidence support more trials in other countries?\nNo evidence to date was found of a generalised adverse side effect with less than 18 months of effect. The evidence from trials was limited and was mainly based on a single-centre, multi-centre, randomized controlled trial. There is a need to perform a systematic review of randomised controlled trials of large groups of people. However, the strength of the evidence is not as strong as those about 'low intensity' or about 'low intensity' interventions. In general trials with randomisation, the results will tend to favour interventions that are significantly more effective than those that are not.\n5.How should recommendations be implemented to reduce CVD rates?\nIn deciding which interventions to implement and how much evidence is needed to recommend new interventions, the focus should be on evidence-based practice. We need to look for evidence from a range of studies, and it is not feasible to give recommendations to an individual patient based on limited data and evidence. Rather, we require an approach with the goal of selecting interventions based on their evidence, and to make any recommendations that are most helpful to individual patients.\n7.What should the health insurance industry do to support and promote CVD and cardiovascular health promotion?\nThe global trends in CVD incidence, and therefore costs should be taken into account for the insurance industry. It is possible that CVD incidence will reach new 'epidemic levels' (a \"consequence event\" should be an event that has no direct causal relationship to another event (e.g. smoking or high blood pressure), and a \"consequence event\" should not be considered if it has a direct relationship to another event, such as a heart attack or stroke.\nCVD is a highly preventable disease. The focus of prevention, particularly in the CVD-preventing community, should be on educating patients and healthcare systems about risks factors and how to reduce cardiovascular disease and related problems (e.g. blood pressure). The need need to raise awareness of the importance and potential benefits of the strategies already discussed in this guidance, is also strongly emphasised.\nThis publication was made possible by the generous support of the UK National Institute of Health and Medical Research, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Wellcome Trust, the Medical Research Council Fund, the Wellcome Trust and the Department", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention? In other words, what recommendations could NICE have given to public health officials in order to advise them, and who would have been affected in terms of mortality and CVD mortality and morbidity?

And, the results of the 16-item Cardiovascular Risk Modification Index (CRM) indicate that an adult of 40 years old has a 96% chance of coronary heart disease (CHD) and a 3% risk for stroke, for example.\nIn this case scenario, NICE would recommend that the Chinese man consider adopting dietary changes that could lower his cholesterol and lipid profiles and that he also engage in a \"lifestyle change\" to reduce his blood pressure and/or cholesterol, such as getting regular exercise and consuming less saturated fat from animal sources and increasing the intake of non-tropical vegetable oils for cooking.

What if they focus on lifestyle changes alone instead of any other factor?\nThe answer: They would not.\nThe American Heart Association has now released a new set of guidelines called the Angioimperative Lifestyle Interventions for Cardiovascular Disease (LIPIC) for those who are at high risk for developing cardiovascular disease. The AHA now recommends a combination of moderate lifestyle changes, including: 75 minutes of physical exercise, 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity each day; healthy eating, aiming for 30% more calories than one would eat per day; and, weight loss < 20% of body weight.\nThe 75-minutes of physical exercise guidelines recommend that the following are targeted at individuals who require moderate intensity exercise as part of their healthcare plan:\n- Walking: 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week (68 minutes total) at a moderate intensity - not more than that\n- Cycling or elliptical (66 minutes total) per week of moderate intensity (not more than 5 cycles per week)\n- Hiking at around 1 hour per week of moderate intensity (not more than 20 minutes per week)\n- HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) - 30-50 minutes a week of moderate-intensity at a 2-minute to 2-minute interval and then 60-90 minutes recovery periods\n- Step training or walking 30 minutes a day in the home (not more than 15 minutes for 2 days/week)\n- Exercise-specific 5k, 45 minute biking (50 minutes and 15 minutes per week)\nThe LIPIC guidelines also include 30 weeks of lifestyle measures. The following are the 30 weeks recommended: 15 weeks of 15 minutes of step training; 4 weeks of 15 minutes of walking at 5 miles per mile; 1 week of 90 minutes of 45 minutes of walking in the same range.\nThe aim of the 30 weeks is to increase the risk-free risk for cardiovascular disease by 2%. The risk-free risk of developing cardiovascular disease is defined as:\n- A 20% risk for the individual at high-risk who is at average risk but within the 20% threshold\n- A 20% risk for the individual at high-risk if moderate-cardiovascular risk and if no one else in the age distribution is at low-risk?\n- A 50% risk for the individual at high-risk if moderate-cardiovascular risk and if no one in the 100% risk is at low-risk?\nNote: This risk-free risk is for the current 20% risk plus new risk in the range of 20% to 50% of the current risk to cause developing cardiovascular disease.\nThe goal is to get the 90 minutes of exercise into the 20% of the risk threshold and then increase to 20 minutes per week of moderate activity with the same period of 15 minutes per week of walking.\nThe 15 to 20 minutes of walking must take place after a minimum 50% reduction in risk based on existing evidence.\nThe 50% reduction risk in the 15 minutes of walking can be achieved by increasing one's walking time by walking 15 minutes every day even if the individual's current age does not fall within the 20% of the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. This is where you can go beyond the traditional 50% reduction of risk per week.\nAn example of how this can be achieved is the following:\n- If a 350 hour course of moderate activity per week means walking at least 30 minutes a day for 5 days a week is acceptable and you can get 50% of the risk, you may be walking 1 hour each day for 0.5 days per week to get 60% of the risk.\n- If a 50% reduction of risk means 4 minutes/week of walking can be achieved, so can a 50% reduction of risk of 20 minutes per week of walking.\n- For a person who is 40 years of age, 85% of the risk of developing cardiovascular disease can be changed by a 50% reduction of risk of being at high-risk", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention? 15.5 years ago What about CVD prevention for the 2021\u20132025-years group?, what recommendations for CVD prevention for the 2021\u20132025-years group? 16.35 years ago, what 10/100 years ago did these groups go through? 17.95 years ago, what 10/100 years ago would have have been the 10th or 10th year of 100/1,000 years ago? 18.59 years ago, if I were to measure my age and get older in years, what would my BMI be if I were to turn 65 years old? 19.04 years ago, if you were to walk in a straight line from one end of the USA to the other end, when and where would it take you to reach a standing height of 6 feet?

I could not find such evidence for that, and I'm not going to have any discussions about it. Is it just that NICE doesn't have anything on their recommendations? Do they consider patients' CVD-related symptoms and risk factors when looking at CVD prevention? -Dr. Michael F. Reilly\n[...] When Dr. Reilly is asked if he is aware that many cardiologists don't have anything on the heart, he shares that he doesn't, but this is an area that requires further investigation. If anyone wishes to have a look at this information via your link, we will be waiting for your feedback. I'd love to hear your thoughts here about NICE's recommendations for CVD prevention. Also, if you are a doctor, how do you make decisions on the lives of patients? I would definitely appreciate this feedback. [...]\nThe answer to both questions is: The answer to both questions is: Nothing! So why is it so difficult for cardiologists, specifically cardiologists who only see patients after they have had a serious medical emergency, to be able to answer these questions? Why? Because it is such a huge task. I don't even know about your research, so my role is a small one: What do you want us to know about CVD? You mentioned a big deal in your article where we find that many doctors who don't have the time to answer your questions, simply make up the answer without even reading the article. Here is an example from the comment we made: The problem is that we don't know exactly what we mean when we talk about \"cardiologists who just don't have time to answer your questions\". Let's be honest, we're trying to do what we can to help people in our immediate community, even though we're always busy (like I do anyway!). \"If you just walk into the doctor's office and say I have a heart attack, does that mean you just \"walk in\"?\" If all your heart attacks are \"in the hospital\" as you say, what is that meaning exactly anyway? If I have a friend's death, do we really know for sure if that could be linked to a heart attack? As a cardiologist, I believe in a \"yes/yes\" answer to these questions because this allows me to focus my clinical research on them. Also, in other words: Why do we not have to ask questions about what's happening to us? No one else should be there, and the only person who should be in charge of your life is you. Because as Dr. Reilly says, \"The heart is really the most vulnerable organ in our bodies\". What's the take-away here? It's that there's no easy answer that is correct or incorrect. We do not know if your friend is \"in the hospital\" on that day, if you've found a coronary artery disease without them knowing, or whether it's a heart attack that was a result of a stress fracture that you've been hit by the car, without their having asked. What's more important is that we still do have access to the health information that is available, and the researchers have to be able to access it for us to have that information, even though it's quite large, if not the big data in the world that is accessible to researchers.

I certainly have some views on other topics, which I feel deserve our full attention because we know that most cardiologists are wrong about it, and the fact that their research is funded isn't an excuse, so I'm glad I can share a couple ideas here.

Therefore, our recommendations for CVD prevention are not intended to be \"one size fits all\". As such, a large, well documented cohort study is recommended for the evaluation, to assess the specificity of the results, and the limitations. However, a retrospective cohort study may not provide the same conclusions. Therefore, we are not suggesting a specific plan for the evaluation and risk factor assessment of CVD, but instead are suggesting that such a large study involving diverse data and individuals across many variables will assist in further understanding and possibly the development of more targeted CVD prevention interventions.\n|Hazen M, Smith G, Bortolame A, et al; Health and Physical Activity in Health and Malnutrition in Chronic Disease: Prospective Studies of Exercise Versus No Exercise During Pregnancy|\n|Hazen M, Smith GB, Johnson G, et al; Health and Physical Activity in Health and Malnutrition in Chronic Disease: A Prospective Study of Exercise Versus No Exercise During Pregnancy|\nAthletic Education | Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research | Journal of Applied Physiology | Journal of Nutrition", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\nI would go for a lipid profile. They advise a triglyceride test and for LDL cholesterol to be the only one. For a healthy person, a normal ratio could reflect normal good/bad cholesterol level.\nA blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg would represent a state with cardiovascular risk. For good cholesterol people with normal blood pressure and normal density of arterial walls, for example, at heart attack/stroke, high cholesterol levels is acceptable.\nThat said, I think NICE's recommendations are a little bit loose. They also recommend not to do \"blood tests\" because that could lead to false positives. So for example \"glucose-stimulated glucose levels >100mg/dl (1.5mmol/L)\" is \"good cholesterol\".\nThere are two common ways to interpret 'good' cholesterol: Good-cholesterol or bad-cholesterol. \"Bad-cholesterol\" doesn't have anything in common with the opposite (good-cholesterol). However, most people have a good cholesterol level at a high-density lipoprotein - aka the \"good\" cholesterol. That also works with a good cholesterol.\nWhat is your opinion if heart attack detection is done with a blood test? I don't know. I would take that one as the \"low-risk\" category. I know that some people have a high-density lipoprotein (good-cholesterol) level, but there's nothing to be done about it. That's just a possibility.\nI know the situation with the cholesterol test results - how does the recommendation change if it's used solely for screening purposes? I know that \"good\" cholesterol can be found with \"good\" and \"bad\" cholesterol. Is that correct? - I don't know what the answer is. I'll just leave the answer to the people on the internet.\nAs I found, only when a health professional refers someone for an \"altered lipid profile,\" or if the person gives him/her information about their cholesterol level and asks to see it, then the recommendation is made that the person has been treated and that the test-result is that a \"great\" cholesterol level for heart health. It seems intuitive or it may be because the recommendation has to be made so that \"good\" cholesterol could only be achieved if people are at any risk for heart disease. That's what we should be doing.\nIt's like we're trying to find the best level of a blood test to get the most benefit from it. I see something that will work.\n1 answer 1 person - 4 years ago", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\nWhat about the 10-year risk reduction from 8 to 10%?\nN1 = low (pre-MI) & >10 % (MI & CV), N2 = low, >10 %, >20% (MI & CV)\nN3 = high (high/high) (MI & CV)\n* In practice, if an individual has a 10 % risk of dying from CVD (N1), is at risk (N2), and no MI and no CV, N1 + N2 = 20, and N3 = 10, then the population mortality risk reduction would be ~20 %. N2 is the death rate due to MI and CV and N3 is the death rate due to an MI and CHD. In the model, N1 + N2 = 30 & N3 is 10, N1 + N2 = 20 and N2 is 10.\nFor the 2017 edition of the NICE manual, a 5-fold increase in risk reduction was assigned for each additional patient group with the exception of 11-14% of patients with a history of MI/CVD and 7% of patients with no history of CVD.\nCardiovascular disease mortality risk management in this model relies on the assumption that the risk of death from CVD or MI would eventually decrease with the progression of the disease progression. However, this hypothesis is not consistent with the data (NICE, 2017).\nIn the model, however, a reduction in risk of death from CVD and mortality from MI are both statistically related (see table below), therefore a reduction in MCI (high cholesterol) and CHD (high blood pressure), while a reduction in MCI and CVD, are both statistically unrelated.\n|Table 1. Table 2, where we present the 5-fold risk reduction model. The reduction models were selected by NICE (2017).|\nCardiovascular disease mortality risk management in this model relies on the assumption that the risk of dying from CVD or MI would eventually decrease with the progression of the disease progression, therefore a reduction in MCI (high cholesterol) and CHD are both statistically related, which we observed in the 2017 model. In this model, however, a reduction in MCI and CVD, are both statistically unrelated, while a decrease in MCI and CVD and a decrease in MCI and CHD are also statistically unrelated.\nTherefore, although the 2017 model is less complex, it is not as rigorous, hence it is unable to explain why a patient with coronary artery disease and a high blood pressure may have a decreased risk of death from CVD or MI. The only 5-fold decrease in risk reduction (10%) is from the first one which is not the same as the other two, but is better understood as another 5-fold increase in risk reduction from each of the 10fold increases in risk reduction in the 2017 model (including one 5-fold reduction from the 10th case) (Fig 1). However, given the limitations in this model, the 5-fold reduction model in the 2017 model is too strict and does not account for risk factors other than the 5-fold increase in risk reduction in 5% of cases.\n(Image credit: Vassiliki B, Marouba, R. et al., NICE, 2017)\nOne reason may be that the 5-fold reduction in risk reduction in this model is too conservative and ignores the possibility of patients with a history of heart disease, with an increased risk of CVD compared to MI, being at high cardiovascular risk even though they have other symptoms other than MI or CHD compared to an MI/CHD alone. An alternate option is to use the three-point cut points as described in the NICE guidelines (2017). This can result in further reductions in risk reduction due to greater change in the 10th case scenario in the model, as observed in the 2017 model.\nGiven how the risk of death from CVD/MI and mortality from coronary artery disease were measured, and the risk reduction for MCI/ CVD that the 2017 model can provide, these models can help to explain why many patients with a history of MI have a reduced risk of death, given that", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\nRecommendation: Use a cholesterol standard of less than 4mmol/L by 2011 for all people aged 20 years and older - these should be lower than the recommended target limit of only 10mmol/L. The following group of people may be eligible to receive a LDL/HDL cholesterol target of 5.5mmol/L:\n- Those aged 35-39\n- Those aged 40-49\n- Those aged 40-49\n- those aged 60-69\n- Those aged 70-79\n- Those aged 70+\n- Those with a BMI 30 or worse\n- Those with a history of smoking\n- Those who are overweight or obese\n- Those who engage in vigorous physical activity\n- Those who have a first degree relative with CVD\n- Those who are alcohol free\n- Those who consume a diet high in saturated and trans fats\nIt is vital to check that the individual's heart rate is within the normal range as far as the person is concerned. Also, see your GP for further reassurance.\nThe mainstay of treatment\nThe primarystay of CVD treatment in this setting is a combination of modifiable lifestyle changes (weight management through healthy diet, exercise, and weight reduction, and smoking cessation) and medication to control major risk factors, including cholesterol and blood pressure. In particular, controlling blood pressure is imperative, both because it lowers CVD risk factors and because it may lower the risk of death. It is also critically important to maintain dietary intake of healthy saturated fat, as this can make the most difference. It is not recommended to treat CVD without such a diet, and there is evidence to suggest that even a low fibre diet can have a substantial beneficial impact. This is particularly true if a higher fibre diet was already in place following your previous diagnosis.\nFor a patient who has a long history of MI, angina, or CAD who is a smoker, there is only one treatment method: aspirin therapy. The role of the aspirin is one of the major determinants of benefit.\nDettani et al reported that a significant decrease in risk of myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) was seen in patients who received aspirin therapy within the 8-12 months following their first coronary bypass surgery. In addition to lowering the risk of myocardial infarction, aspirin reduced the risk of coronary artery disease by 13% (10.7%, and 8.2%, respectively). This may help to explain the dramatic reduction in MI at up to 11 year follow up. The role of aspirin therapy in lowering MI has not been confirmed with studies of MI related to other heart conditions. The benefit, however, is encouraging in terms of the improved quality of life.\nTreatment options should be reviewed in the patient's final year of follow up after a new CV event because new coronary artery stenoses (heart attacks) have been identified as a risk factor for future MI. In this group of patients, aspirin therapy reduces their risk by 6%. It seems reasonable to recommend aspirin therapy for this group, provided that additional treatment options are available (eg: antiarrhythmic drugs, anticoagulation, nutritional support if necessary).\nAn increased risk of CAD may also be lowered by a dose-dependent interaction between aspirin and statins. This finding is consistent with the results of a large cohort of patients admitted to the ER after MI. Patients with coronary artery disease who had received statins were more likely to be prescribed aspirin than those who had neither drugs, and this effect may only be offset by a dose-dependent interaction between statins and aspirin.\nAspirin is a safe drug; however, it carries some possible risks and side effects including a low platelet count, low calcium levels in the blood, and angina. Aspirin for angina, however, may well be the next best option.\nDettani et al. found that a lower total cholesterol in the presence of moderate CVD was associated with a 6.7% increased risk of CAD, while an increased level of HDL and decreased prevalence of smoking were associated with a 13.0% and 8.5% risk reduction respectively.\nThe risk of adverse drug interactions for aspirin was reduced with further aspirin and statin treatment.\nFor patients with diabetes, aspirin therapy is now regarded as the 'gold standard'. However, it has not been evaluated in practice to a similar degree in this group of patients as aspirin is in the general population.\nDettani et al reported that patients", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\nA: NICE has given a very specific statement - to use dietary and lifestyle modifications if these changes have no impact on the cardiovascular health of the patient.\nIf it does make the patient feel better, or if the patient is at increased risk for CVDs, then there would be less pressure to look at a more complex dietary and lifestyle approach.\nWhy this is important\n\"What we want to show is that patients can make choices about eating and exercising, which has the potential to help them reduce risk by a significant proportion of the risk,\" NICE says.\n\"That should be a strong motivational incentive for patients to make healthy lifestyle change. Many will prefer to get exercise on their own.\"\nThe approach can be implemented by the same team as interventions for the other 10 common CVDs.\nWhy is the approach important? Well - if the patient is obese, they are much more likely to develop diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\nBy improving their diet and exercise habits, more of them will be able to lower their risk of these health problems.\nThis idea also means that if the patient is not active, but if they have been told that it's appropriate to do more exercise and less sitting, or if they are in a social setting where they can meet like-minded friends or patients can join them in this area, then they will be more engaged and have the time to put that into practice.\nWhat this means\nThe way that NICE will be implemented changes slightly from NICE's advice on CVDs due to their new approach.\n\"We will be setting out more in-depth recommendations for people with existing conditions that are more than one of these CVDs but who might have a greater burden of CVDs,\" NICE says.\nAnd \"people with diabetes will probably receive their weight, blood pressure and cholesterol, and blood-thinning treatment more consistently and less in this way. The recommendation is to deliver the same advice and make different choices across the spectrum from the same individual,\" states NICE.\n- 1.

They say that schizophrenia can significantly interfere with the central mechanisms necessary for controlling blood sugar levels.\n\"These results may help to clarify some of the important differences in outcomes for these conditions between these populations,\" lead author Sarah L. Mathers, Ph.D., noted in the April 2017 Medical Post.\n\"Future research, especially in the context of the population-based diabetes study in Sweden, should investigate whether those with schizophrenia may benefit from treatment with mood hormone modulators. However, it is likely that psychiatric disorders are also accompanied by obesity, which can worsen the risk of developing diabetes,\" Mathers continued.\nWhile researchers still require more information to make firm conclusions about the effects of mental illness and diabetes on each other, there has been a large body of evidence that suggests a common cause of both conditions.\n\"One factor that seems to be a lot more important is that people who have schizophrenia, especially in early adolescence, might be more prone to develop diabetes,\" said Mathers. \"What this means is that it might be that certain environmental factors are more important, and that some kinds of lifestyle and diet might be important in preventing these risks for both.\"", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\nOne factor considered in any case: \u201cIt\u2019s never too late\".

However, the researchers advise caution to avoid excessive saturated fat and trans fat, along with alcohol use (the World Health Organization recommends up to 1\u20132 drinks per day of alcohol but that could require over-exaggeration with alcohol consumption).\n- In a study of men aged 50-49 who were at-risk for non-communicable diseases, it confirmed that the Mediterranean diet is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause deaths, particularly cancers.\n- The NICE guidelines suggest a diet aiming for a moderate intake of 2 portions of fruit and vegetables per day, moderate amount of fish, moderate amount of poultry, and moderate amount of red meat, as well as no extra sugar added.\n- The NICE guideline recommends individuals at high risk for CVD or any chronic disease to switch to a keto diet, which reduces their body fat stores, thereby reducing LDL cholesterol.\n- A small evidence-based trial also found a reduced risk to having heart attack and stroke by eliminating processed foods and red meat for 25 days.\n- For prevention of cardiovascular disease, a meta-analysis from England and the Chinese city of Tianjin showed that patients who follow a low-fat diet had a 65% lower risk of heart attack or death in later life.\n- A low-fat, and low energy diet was associated with a lower risk of developing metabolic syndrome; an increase in high-density lipoprotein levels; and a decrease in triglyceride levels in the blood. A lower high-density lipoprotein level is an indicator of blood fats (such as cholesterol), and high levels of high-density lipoproteins, in this case, can lead to LDL cholesterol or LDL to HDL cholesterol being lower in people. A higher level of high-density lipoproteins (HDL cholesterol) is associated with a decreased risk of heart attacks and MI in persons with metabolic syndrome.\n- Research has shown that regular aerobic exercise (walking, jogging, swimming) and endurance exercise, such as cycling can reduce the risk of myocardial infarction in adults with low-HDL cholesterol and obesity; but that for people with diabetes or heart disease, the same effect appears to be less and more pronounced.\n- Recent research has shown that exercise, in particular aerobic exercise training for at least 150 minutes per week is linked to a decrease in blood clots in the arteries after a cardiac event by about 60%.\n- Exercise has also been shown to reduce the risk of death and complications related to heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.\n- There are three categories of exercise- each with its own guidelines:\n- Weight training and moderate weight training (3-5 kg/week), where you build up muscle strength.\n- High impact aerobics such as running, cycling, and swimming.\n- Dynamic aerobics (involving lots of movement and hard-hitting), when you move about in a sports setting.\nHigh pressure for a 500-ml wine - the science?\nThe current science on wine consumption is still in a state of flux. In fact, some scientists disagree on whether we should increase or decrease our consumption of wine.\nHowever, with the support of a recent review published in the BMJ Journal, the expert opinion is likely to be that increasing or decreasing consumption of wine are both healthy, and both support the current UK dietary recommendations and the WHO guidelines. In other words, most of the wine in the world is sweet, and the wine trade is highly profitable.\nThe authors of the review explain that the EU regulations restrict the level of moderate (i.e. wine) consumption in the EU, and those in Australia are more tolerant of high alcohol consumption. The review says that if the EU regulations are relaxed (i.e. reduced), wine consumption can be increased, and that wine can be used to reduce cholesterol, and lower blood pressure and blood glucose. In addition, the review notes that it is better to enjoy alcohol in moderation.\nThe researchers agree that moderate wine consumption is associated with a decrease in cardiovascular mortality, reduced risk of chronic kidney diseases, and reduced risks of diabetes and cancer. Moderate wine consumption has the benefit of having a positive effect on overall health, and therefore it appears to offer important benefits to a healthier lifestyle.", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention? How would the guideline differ for individuals at different risk levels? At what level of risk are individuals at optimal risk, or are these risk factors being ignored? When and how should a patient determine his or her optimal risk level based on the above parameters?\nWhen prescribing pharmacotherapy for CVD, it is important to understand the importance of understanding the physiological responses caused by the individual patients' baseline health status.\nIf a patient's lifestyle is poor and is not able to maintain a consistent lifestyle, it will cause a decrease in the ability to achieve ideal health indices that could lead to CVD. People with low blood pressure will have a higher risk of having a stroke than someone in a healthy blood pressure range with a high blood pressure. A person with a history of CVD and a history of diabetes will be at higher risk than a person with no history of CVD or who has normal blood pressure and a history of diabetes.\nIn assessing CVD risk, we should be able to recognize when a person feels an increased need for medications. A person experiencing the most need for medications will tend toward higher risk than someone whose physician could perform the assessment and who is knowledgeable about the underlying causes contributing to CVD. If the patient presents a change in his or her cardiovascular functioning, such as an elevated cardiovascular risk index, or if the risk factors are consistently increasing, this may indicate a need for additional pharmacotherapy.\nWhat is a baseline risk level?\nThis can be determined through routine physical examinations or by self-administered screening testing. If the result is consistently above the norm, it should be noted and referred to a physician. We may refer to this patient's baseline with the following term: Atterable risk level (ARL): When is a patient at the highest level of risk, or when is a person at optimal risk?\nThis term refers to how high these values fall under the curve or when to treat the patient first regarding CVD risk.\nThe next step in identifying healthy lifestyle changes is to address lifestyle changes using a personalized management approach.", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?

The key recommendation for CVD prevention is an individual intervention to improve blood pressure, lower cholesterol levels, reduce obesity, and lose weight on a more energetic, high-intensity diet. NICE also acknowledges the potential for individual responses to these interventions.\nThe NICE guidance offers recommendations, and the relevant evidence does not come from the single intervention alone, but is rather an analysis of complementary interventions which have been tried to have positive effects over time and demonstrate differences in their outcomes, making it a useful model to follow when designing the NHS, and other public health policy interventions.\nIt is not new for CVD prevalence - studies have measured blood pressure (BP) since the 1960s and have consistently established that hypertension (HT) is the most common and preventable factor for stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality (all of which are associated with high BP).\nOn the NHS, a 14-year, 11.5-year period after the publication of Maddison's report in 1998 represents the most recent data available on the prevalence of high blood pressure (hypertension) across a 30-year period and from which to extrapolate findings from existing evidence.\nThe Maddison work was done during a time of significant economic and health care costs, and the health of many older people is a concern at the time. The findings do not, however, imply that other individuals, particularly in high-income areas, are unaffected by hypertension, suggesting the role of the medical profession in understanding the role of hypertension in older people, and in providing individualised help to the elderly population.\nIt is important to note that the results are based on the population of population in terms of age and the proportion of men and women. Other studies have also demonstrated the role of the social environment on the prevalence of hypertension, and the factors influencing these levels of association, particularly in low income and working-class communities.\nThe results of the second and third cohorts of the Maddison study indicate high BP, and a strong protective effect on CVD risk.\nIt is notable, however, that both cohorts of the Maddison study had a wide age range. In 2003, one cohort had 10-year data for the total population, and the other cohort 11-year data for both of these cohorts. The age at first BP measurement was 85 years, and the data for the cohort with 11-year data included all cases of hypertension in the cohort with 10-year data and was analysed using age stratified data.\nThe Maddison study is an excellent example of the complex relationship between physical activity, smoking and hypertension and CVD prevention and could be applied in many circumstances to other diseases. It appears that physical activity can be beneficial for the general population, but not so for CVD, by being overweight and obesity and therefore the incidence of CVD increases. In other words, even with the most modest improvements, the impact may not be strong enough. For example, studies with obese older people have found that the health of this subgroup of older people remains unchanged at any age, irrespective of exercise programmes.\nOther studies have also shown a positive, when adjusted for differences in BP and smoking exposure, inverse association between BP and the risk of mortality from CVD in the other cohorts. Such studies, however, are not able to directly answer whether physical activity reduces CVD risk.\nThe results of the Maddison study strongly indicate that physical activity plays a key role in prevention of CVD. However, for the purposes of the guidelines, it is important to identify a level of activity that is best able to reduce the risk of CVD by 5% or less. That is likely to be the level recommended in the National Guideline Setting Framework, which requires that an individual should perform the same amount of physical activity at least twice during the week. (NICE guidelines for physical activity are set out very briefly in Appendix A). In a 12-month longitudinal study on the effect of physical activity levels on the risk of incident CVD in older UK men, the results revealed modest increases in CVD incidence among those who were overweight, with a slightly lower frequency of CVD events, but not enough to", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\nThis is not a good answer. The latest NICE guidance, published in January 2020, offers this helpful framework for evaluating the risk of CVD for every patient:\n- Identify whether a patient has a history of smoking, alcohol consumption, high fasting blood pressure, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or either of these conditions.\n- Use a calculator to find out if the patient meets the four risk categories:\n- If the patient does not meet one of these categories, the risks assessment can be based on the following:\nThe results of an individual-based risk assessment can be expressed as follows:\n- If a patient has a total cholesterol value of less than 250 mg/dl, a total HDL value of less than 65, a fasting blood glucose value equal to or greater than 110 mg/dl, glucose level with visual analogue scale of 7, an age of 55 years and less than 55 years, hypertension risk factors no longer present, a patient has diabetes, or follows a low-fat diet, the risk assessment can be expressed as:\n- After the calculations, the following table will be useful as a guidance guide:\nFor the calculation of the probability of CVD mortality in all patients aged 18 years and more, a 1%ile risk reduction (for example, 0.1%) would be expressed as:\n- a 5%ile risk reduction of CVD mortality (for example, 1.5%ile).\nThe NICE guideline also offers an alternative guidance to the risk assessment approach for patients with high total cholesterol values: if there has been a clinical diagnosis of at least one atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk factor, the level of blood cholesterol (not just the total) cannot be reduced below the threshold of one-third (33%) for the calculation of the probability of one additional CVD event.\nIn this case, the risk of CVD mortality will be calculated as:\n- a 1-month increase in BP, not exceeding 100/year, but a 5-year increase in CVD mortality of more than 10% (assuming all variables are stable).\nA risk assessment would suggest following a 5-year diet pattern based on the following guidelines:\n- If BP is 140/90 or more for 12 weeks, to the same level as normal, dietary pattern and intake of fat can be reduced to 30/60gm. If BP is 140/99 or more, the dietary pattern can be maintained by reducing total saturated fat to 50/50 or vice versa. If blood pressure is 140/90, BP needs to start to decrease to 80/50. If blood pressure is greater than 140/90 or more, the changes can be made to the diet.\nThe NICE guideline also offers the following support for patients with high total cholesterol values and no CVD risk factors, but there is variability:\n- To a lesser extent, low-fat diet following the low-fat dietary pattern of NICE guidelines, and the following guidelines:\n- to a reduced BP of less than 6.5 mmHg or below by about 50% (for example, 4000 mg/day), reducing total fat intake to 15-26% of daily calories, restricting or avoiding saturated fat and cholesterol (except in the very young and extremely morbid.\n- or restricting the intake of high LDL cholesterol levels to 20-40mg/dl.\nTo a greater extent, the NICE guideline says:\n- to reduce the saturated fat intake of 7% of the total daily calories, limiting the amount of LDL cholesterol to less than 7% of total calories, or restricting the intake of high low-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol to 70mg/dl.\n- or reducing the total energy intake of 30% of the total calories.\n- or the use of a specific lipid lowering drug (e.g. statins).\n- For both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-PC) and triglycerides (TG), the recommendation is based on a new clinical recommendation: for the 15-year period up to 150mg/dl blood levels to be <15ml/L.\n- If a patient has an age of <50 years, 250mg/dl blood levels over", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention? How would the relevant data be identified and accessed?\n\n---\n\nThe article starts by describing NICE's *recommendation list* for CVD prevention:\n\n* **Diabetes, hypertension, obesity**\n* **Cancers**\n* **Hypertension**\n* **Pulmonary disease**\n* **Cardiovascular and cancer**\n\nAs it progresses, the authors introduce relevant medical data relevant for CVD prevention, such as:\n\n* **Total cholesterol**\n* **HDL cholesterol**\n* **LDL cholesterol**\n* **Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol**\n* **LDL cholesterol and triglycerides**\n\nFinally, they present NICE guidelines for CVD prevention:\n\n* **Smoking, number of former smokers**, annual smoking, number of chronic lung diseases, smoking history,\n* **Exercise**, 150 minutes daily, fitness level,\n* **Blood pressure and heart rate**\n* **Blood pressure and smoking history**, 200-1300 mmHg,\n* **Hypertension**\n\n---\n\nThis information highlights the importance of tailoring the classification of risk to the patient's individual needs based on their past lifestyle and current health state. While the initial article provided valuable insights into NICE's approach to CVD prevention, it also suggested ways to improve the process based on the insights provided. By combining both NICE's recommendations and the available data, physicians and health professionals would have a more comprehensive understanding of CVD risk, leading to better patient outcomes.", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention? We look at those key points from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence: the term 'healthy' may actually be misleading because many people with high blood pressure may achieve well-controlled high blood pressure under normal conditions. The definition of 'healthy' is 'an individual's status according to measures such as weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, or BMI that reflects the extent to which the risk of disease has been reduced and achieved within a given period of time'. However, the term 'healthy' doesn't mean that a high blood pressure state (such as defined as the highest systolic blood pressure or the highest diastolic blood pressure, plus or minus) has either disappeared or has been significantly modified. Rather, it suggests that a well-controlled, healthy state does exist - a state where many people suffer no symptoms, and that some individuals do. It would, of course, be a valid concern to avoid smoking as well, because of the well-established association of tobacco smokers to a greater risk of heart disease and stroke. Indeed, smokers are five times more likely than non-smokers to die early."], "5": ["What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\nJohn's profile was similar to that of a general physician or other general practitioners. He was well documented and had a positive and satisfactory record of medical care.\nHe used one treatment plan that included regular exercise. The plan included a healthy diet, appropriate exercise, and, to a lesser extent, a regular medication regimen. He also used counseling about blood pressure control. None of the major risk factors was present.\nThe main recommendation for John's study was a \"lifestyle\" approach. \"Healthy lifestyle is the first line of treatment. These patients are at the highest risk for coronary heart disease.\" In most cases their lifestyle factors were insufficient. Thus their target weight was 25-30 kg, their intake of saturated fats, trans fat, and sugar was at or very close to that consumed by the general population, as well as their blood pressure remained at or above the 120/75 systolic level.\nJohn may have been a good candidate for cardiovascular disease treatment because (1) his blood pressure was at a 23/12 mm Hg level, (2) his smoking status was no longer high, (3) his recent diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia (30% or higher) and the known effect of smoking on his risk for CVD, and (4) he already had a reasonable level of fitness and physical activity.\nWhat are some of the lifestyle factors that John used? How have they changed since his baseline for his cholesterol level, and he now has a target reading of 190/105? Also, had his diet changed?\nJohn had a high BMI (prevalence of overweight/obesity of 52.2%). That was also the result of his history. His BMI had jumped from 28.5 in 1987, to 31.5 in 2007 to 32.7 in 2008. He also had a waist circumference of 38 inches, which is higher than the American Heart Association's standard definition for healthy weight. The abdominal circumference is less than the 14th centile, but higher than the 90th percentile. \"My husband's waist is 94\", he says.\nJohn's blood pressure was elevated (298/120 for the month). There was no evidence of diabetes either for John or for his other major risk factors. He was not smoking, but smoked regularly a total of 11 years ago. \"My blood pressure usually stayed at or very near the normal level but the blood pressure in John remained high.\"\nJohn had taken his medication. He did have a low dose of statin (for cholesterol). He started taking a statin when he was 47. \"I don't think I was going to use a statin later, but I wouldn't have gotten it,\" says John. The \"newest\" statin for John is Truvac (ceftriaxone tartrate), which was given in addition to the older drug (mezolizumab) which he was prescribed.\nJohn's lifestyle has changed significantly compared with what was used at the time. He now eats as he usually does, eats at least 3 days of meals a day at a normal, relatively simple, fast pace. He has a personal and family responsibility for his diet, and if a certain food is consumed in excess, it is eaten at a normal, rather than in the \"high\" category.\nIt is difficult to obtain clear information on the nutritional status of John. Yet John's condition likely has been caused by the fact that he was too overweight when he started to be thin and lean. Although a BMI of less than 25 was normal before he began to eat poorly, he then gained weight and continued to eat. This increased risk could explain his higher cholesterol level after cessation of tobacco smoking, and he may have been using steroids, which might also contribute to his elevated cholesterol.\nJohn has also been at risk for diabetes because of the presence of a family history of diabetes and related co-morbidities. His BMI in earlier years was about 28.5, and the history of smoking tobacco was brief. The history of diabetes (no other disease is discussed in this report.) is long, but I never saw diabetes related problems listed.\nJohn started to lose weight when he started to quit smoking, which he did because he was worried that he would become an adult smoker. By now, he has had multiple episodes of bronchitis and a persistent cough, but", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD? (I know. It would be interesting to hear advice from other providers). I can be told not to rely just on NICE guidelines as they are likely to have a small number of relevant cases and will also be lacking some information related to their individual patient characteristics.\nAnd what about the following: why are there no recommendations on the \"diet, physical activity and alcohol\" recommendations? Given the numbers in the 2012 UK Coroners' Data-Recorder (UKDCDR) which were reviewed on behalf of the DCHC, it seems unlikely that an \"ideal\" diet will satisfy anyone with CVD. However, even without a detailed dietary recommendation such as the DCHC, a diet low in saturated fat, with 60 min of moderate exercise each week, and also low in alcohol appears useful regardless of a man's BMI, although a lot of observational studies have not replicated similar findings. This is one of the reasons a large-scale cross-sectional cohort study such as the one described here might be key to assessing whether an individual's diet or physical activity level is important in mitigating the risk of developing CVD (the US-funded Community Preventive Intervention for Preventing Cardiovascular Disease, ICPI-RCMA-700: A prospective cohort study involving 310,980 patients using the SSM) is relevant for any individual.\nSome of these recommendations (both dietary guidelines and physical activity recommendations) may be better described as \"prevention guidelines\". But what does it mean?\nIf the WHO definition of a risk factor is not \"prevention\" then we could probably be talking about recommending a specific activity level rather than a specific dietary or physical activity level. That is, a certain physical activity or certain dietary recommendations will be beneficial while a certain Dietary and Physical Activity recommendation is completely useless. This would be the same type of approach that the US-funded International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) used in their work \"Pflege in Cancer Prevention\" to recommend the \"diet, physical activity and alcohol\" approach and advise against consumption of alcohol and saturated fat.\nThe role of physical activity (PA) in CVD prevention (the WHO report) was not discussed in this article.\nFor me, one of the most important questions is: Why are there no recommendations on the \"diet, physical activity and alcohol\" approach to CVD prevention?\nThere seems to be a lot of evidence for the notion that CVD risk can be increased by avoiding a diet poor in fat and saturated fat (and/or eating less meat and dairy products, for example), and of the importance of physical activity when looking at the effects of physical activity (or, in some cases, exercise - for example, in the case of diabetes). These associations are still present, and evidence is starting to accumulate showing a strong positive association between physical activity and heart function (for discussion see my other recent work). Furthermore, the \"diet, physical activity\" approach seems not to be particularly beneficial for CVD.\nLet me clarify that I am merely referring to:\nThe recommendations for physical inactivity seem to have a similar message to the recommendations for eating in a healthful or \"diet\" form in our studies, where the recommendations are: (i) do not make your lifestyle part of your lifestyle (for a person who lives alone), (iii) do not make it part of your lifestyle (for a person living in a household), etc.\nIn short, I think that the \"diet, physical activity\" approach has some very strong and convincing evidence supporting it, particularly in relation to diet and exercise, as both were shown by the studies mentioned above.\nFor example, some of these studies have shown that eating too little or too much of certain foods (for example, a low intake of fruits and vegetables), or eating too little or too much processed meat (i.e. that high intakes of red and processed meat is associated with higher levels of dietary cholesterol intake and/or higher body fat), etc. Another example is shown in my other recent work on the relationship between eating much of the processed poultry, and heart disease risk, which is shown on my page on this website.\nThe \"diet, physical activity, and alcohol\" approach is also a method used (in the UKDCDR) to determine whether dietary or physical activity intervention is appropriate for a patient to be provided in one of the following modalities (the US-funded community intervention for preventing CVD, ICPI-RCMA-700; IARC-CRCMA 701):\n", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\n- What advice would a physician with a background in diabetes provide in the case of a blood pressure level of 79 mmHg - but with more than 51 minutes of physical activity per week?\n- What guidelines would you recommend (see below) for a patient with diabetes who would like to have his cholesterol and blood pressure levels kept at a normal level?\nThe Canadian Centre Of Disease Control report gives advice on these levels in the context of overall cardiovascular risks.\n- Cholesterol Level is >240\n- Blood pressure level is greater than 140/90 mmHg\n- BMI >30, is a cause for immediate cardiovascular risk and needs immediate treatment\n- Blood pressure level in the upper limit is the best blood pressure\n- Blood pressure level in the lower limit is considered safe and can be kept at this level until other important risk management methods are reached\n- Smoking is NOT a risk factor for CVD and is not considered a risk factor for disease if a patient's smoking levels have not elevated.\nYou may want to discuss the recommendation below with your doctor and discuss it in terms of other lifestyle changes as best your doctor can.", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\n\nIt would be nice if there would be a link that you have mentioned, but John is too young to give any medical advice for his situation but I would be surprised if your friend does! He has a history of stroke, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis and hypertension, (the latter a potential CHD risk factor). This would be a good time to consult with a specialist for further details.\n\nPlease note that most cancers are still largely undertreated in Singapore, so this isn't a good situation to be watching when you can talk without fear of medical negligence.\n\nRegards,\n\nMr John (Chang_Y)\n\u2022 ##### Medical Advice\n1\n\nThanks for the advice.\n\nI'm sorry, I should have mentioned the need for a medical check-up on John.\n\nHe has hypertension and not diabetes, his cholesterol levels are high and he has arthritis, but that's not a significant risk factor, except maybe for diabetes and arthritis.\n\nHe will probably have a blood pressure test on top of a lipid panel to make sure he's healthy, too.\n\nJohn, when you mention myocardial infarction, is that correct? I would expect people who have had a major stroke don't have heart disease because they are living their life. They have to work a lot and they have to take care of their finances, right? Then I could add that you both seem to have some sort of risk factor.\n\nI don't know if this is related to your questions but I'm sure the chances of death from a cardiovascular event are very small.\n\nJohn, is he having a heart attack?\n\nI certainly wouldn't know, as he has a history of high BP before, and there's nothing to consider. He's just starting this course for lifestyle and does nothing to improve.\n\nIf there's anything that I can look up about John, he seems to be a young man. I am not surprised that there is a problem related to his young age although that would be expected so obviously since there's nothing quite as young.\n\nJohn, he has hypertension and not cancer, his cholesterol levels are high and he has arthritis, but that's not a significant risk factor, except maybe for diabetes and arthritis.\n\nJohn, when you mention myocardial infarction, is that correct?\n\nI'd be surprised if it isn't. My advice would be to get checked for coronary heart disease as I think I'm going to have it in the next six months (or sooner) and it would be a good idea to get tested for diabetes as well.\n\nJohn\n\u2022 ##### Medical Advice\n2\n\nVery good. I would have thought this could go the same way. However, my son has had his heart transplant since 1993 and it's been well attended and well managed. Then one day he had a stroke and he had a heart attack, and he needs to have a blood pressure check. The first thing I asked is how much of a problem he has with his cholesterol.\n\nJohn, is that correct. He has high BP so is the one, but he doesn't have hypertension because he has left the hospital within six months to get it fixed.\n\nJohn, the first thing I ask is what is the risk of coronary heart disease. He doesn't have it and I am certain that his cholesterol would increase because of the other things that the risk is low. So is that a risk factor rather than just taking a 10, like we do? My son would have had his cholesterol checked two days earlier but still it wasn't that high and a good lifestyle change from smoking can help.\n\nJohn, it may be that his cholesterol should be reduced as we were talking about earlier. I would ask a different question. What percentage of an adult is prone to heart disease? How many children are prone to heart disease, what does that tell us?\n\nI do not want to say that we are totally ignorant of our own health, we simply have not had the freedom to ask questions about it.\n\nJohn, I would ask then is there another cause for his condition. I would like to go the last step of a family history check and see if he has one or not and how old they are.\n\nJohn, I'd like to ask if he is being obese or not, since he has a lot of stress in the house because of his father. My father is overweight and this is contributing to his conditions.

As they state, the most effective drugs are those that are highly absorbed by the body. One example of a drug that is well absorbed is metformin (me-trul-etin), a drug that is often prescribed to treat type 2 diabetes. A dose of 600mg has proven to be effective for some people with schizophrenia, but only in small quantities and in the short term.\n\nA more powerful drug that has been shown to improve quality of life is the antipsychotic chlorpromazine (kim-prah-nez-mek), though they note that this drug can be fatal to the unsuspecting patient. I recently came across a news story entitled \"Can Chlorpromazine Be Beneficial For People With Depression? And Then Where's The Evidence?\" There is quite a controversy about this finding, but there are many studies (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3105962/) on the effect of chlorpromazine on depression.\n\nThe conclusion at this time is that: \"Clinical studies demonstrate that treatment is more effective for treating depressive and schizophrenic symptoms than for treating major depressive disorders or schizophrenia.\"\n\n## Wednesday, May 09, 2012\n\n### Focal Ischemic Stroke in the Elderly\n\nFocal ischemic stroke is an uncommon condition and requires a much higher number of detailed diagnoses than does diffuse stroke, which is a condition where multiple strokes are equally likely. Focal Ischemic Stroke primarily affects older people with a history of severe strokes. There are three main categories: noncompressible transient ischemic attack, subarachnoid haemorrhage, and ischemic proximal cerebral infarction. The condition is named after its location on the brain \u2013 that involved is from the area within the area where the blood vessel was located. Most often this is the middle or posterior cerebral artery and causes a temporary pain while one walks or performs other activities. The pain is typically dull and the pain is the same as that felt during a sprain or strain.\n\nFocal Ischemic Stroke is usually associated with cognitive impairment and dementia as well as acute symptoms such as seizures or paralysis. It can be difficult to differentiate, and the diagnostic criteria need clarification in order to diagnose this condition.\n\nThe clinical and pathophysiological basis for a focal ischemic stroke is often the same as other areas on the scene. Patients with focal or subaortic ischemic stroke must have a single attack of ischemic stroke leading to the acute course of the disease. This acute course usually lasts only one week and the patient usually has a sudden onset of symptoms, is acute, and has one of a number of diagnoses (i.e. stroke, migraine, brain injury, brain tumor, peripheral vascular disease or peripheral neuropathy). All three of these reasons are used as the diagnostic criteria.\n\n## February 2, 2012\n\n### A 30-Year-Old Man: A 36-Year-Old Man\n\nThis story about my 36-year-old uncle has some great things to talk about.\n\n\u2022 he was a high school/college freshman (he did not speak English at school)\n\u2022 he is currently married\n\u2022 he is an entrepreneur\n\u2022 he can carry a heavy load\n\u2022 he is a good sportsman\n\u2022 he is physically fit as well.\n\u2022 he is well to improve his mental state.\n\u2022 he is in good financial condition\n\nHis history is the best I have ever known, and he comes from a healthy family (his grandfather, for example, had some chronic heart failure). He came from a wealthy family in a country where the price of cigarettes is much higher for men.\n\nHe has high blood pressure (it is one of his highest numbers), and for the previous years has had two strokes.\n\nHe was diagnosed with ischemic stroke due to an enlarged carotid artery (in his head) over my left eye which may explain his problems with my sight.\n\nHe is an excellent footballer and had played for the Boston Red Sox, Minnesota Twins and Boston Red Sox.\n\nHow did he get this diagnosis?\n\nThe diagnostic work up has to be", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD? Is that not an indication of a possible risk of developing CHD?", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\n19. It is possible that your doctor will examine you when you have a simple screening tool or a routine blood test to screen for heart disease. The results of the screening tests will give your doctor more information about the state of your heart health. It provides you with a basis for treatment which will have the best chance of success.\n20. The key to keeping blood pressure at good levels should not be complicated or complicated procedures, but through simple healthy lifestyle changes and the medicines currently available and which your doctor will prescribe you, you can stay at the ideal heart-healthy level - an excellent level!\n21. You will gain the best chance of keeping the arteries of the blood vessels healthy by exercising regularly. Regular exercise will naturally improve blood pressure in people who exercise (and are at risk of developing cardiovascular disease) - it increases the \"glucocorticoid\" hormone in the body that's being produced and is a great blood pressure-controlling food - and it's a bonus for keeping your blood pressure in good shape!\n22. A simple blood pressure cuff should be placed around the arm on the opposite side of the elbow. If you are experiencing symptoms of low blood pressure, please discuss the potential for low blood pressure with your doctor as soon as possible.\n23. Having a good blood pressure is not the only thing that matters most for your heart and your overall health. Your heart needs a good amount of rest and you will need to eat a healthy diet to support blood flow and to keep the heart strong and healthy.\n24. To keep healthy, I recommend that people eat a nutrient-rich diet full, of course, of all available produce, which provides the body with many nutrients in a convenient size. Having enough fruit and vegetables is also important, but remember that all other things that are necessary for good health also get good amounts of vegetables.\n25. The following should also be considered:\n\u2022 Try to eat small regular meals, at regular times, and when eating, take enough to satisfy your hunger (a small snack of something sweet or something salty might fill you up all at once).\n\u2022 Eating meals around the same time each day is best.\n\u2022 Avoid processed foods, if possible.\n\u2022 Drink plenty of liquids (be sure you always have a glass of water during your meal), and avoid excessive amounts of any other type of food (other than water).\n\u2022 Avoid alcohol.\n\u2022 Exercise regularly on a regular basis, preferably for at least 30 minutes, most days of the week.\n\u2022 Maintain your weight within a healthy range (i.e. maintain your weight with a good diet rather than cutting your calories too closely so that you weigh very little on a regular basis, then you are much more likely to gain weight over time).\n\u2022 Drink alcohol only in moderation.\n26. Having normal heart function improves the quality and quantity of blood flow for the individual as he improves and his condition improves. For a normal heart to function as intended, the heart must pump blood to the organs and tissues, and also the muscles that do not work as well.\n27. Normal functioning heart does not generate and release blood that is used up by the muscles, lungs, other organs, or the heart itself, which is why some people are so ill from long use of the heart. (Most people say they feel tired, even a short nap is required to improve their fitness.)\n28. Exercise causes many other changes in the arteries to be affected, and as the tissue and organs of a healthy heart work better, a change of function (not just the heart's) is usually the only change required; it will also improve the quality and quantity of blood.\n29. By exercising regularly, many different changes occur in the arteries and capillaries, changes which will eventually affect blood pressure. The body will get more oxygen to work properly, the circulation is improved, and blood flow into the vessels increases, leading to reduced heart strain and possible changes in your heart function.\n30. You will be looking for a way to increase the effectiveness of the exercise, or will be finding it more difficult.\n31. It can be a challenge to start exercising. It is often possible to start and then keep exercising, with no problems at all, if you do it in an upright position with some form of activity every week.\n32. The best way to start is to be introduced to exercise gradually, with as few days off as possible. This will not only help you avoid muscle soreness, but it will also increase", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\nI have to get rid of my old lady, and in the last few years I have had 2 different type of congestive heart failure - a 45kg woman with an established clinical heart failure and a 59kg man with no previous heart disease. The woman's diastolic pressure increased 800mmHg during the period she was on her diuretic medication. The man's diastolic pressure increased more - 1200mmHg - the rate of worsening was higher, but also a 1.4 mmHg difference in systolic pressure. Since he was taking three medications he could control hypertension, and he was on four pills of potassium a day. I was at the beginning of the disease, but because he was on several medications he was a little bit overwhelmed. The reason I had my doctor's visit is because he was a primary care physician who had no heart disease experience and didn't have a heart disease diagnosis. I also had my first episode of heart attack about 5 years ago, but it was a 10 minute attack, so I couldn't make any real changes until I was diagnosed with a heart attack. My doctor and I tried trying to lose weight, exercise, improve my diet, but I was just about on the verge of dying - he couldn't put me in bed, it was an instant death! So, I have been trying to put him in bed and give him a change in medication. What are your thoughts on getting rid of John by reducing his weight - I just can't get rid of John. He's probably the same size as my 5'5', and has a heart like me in my 76-80th percentile. What type of surgery should I do... and do you think it could be performed in the United States? Is he still at 85 degrees or was he 60 degrees in fact?\n12 years ago, I was being treated for a case of a myocardial infarct from being hypertensive for 40 years, and they told me I need to exercise (something I'm quite able to do now). Since I am hypertensive, I do not wish to become hypothermic (because I would have a heart problem). After my last bout of heart action, I made the effort to do cardio exercises and exercises which were performed by a colleague, and after a couple months I am doing the exercise I love, and still not fully recovered and feel good enough to go through my normal physical activities. It is a lot easier to exercise the lower body, but it is a lot hard to get up and down the stairs, do the kettlebells, do the dumbbells, start a lift. I am worried that it will be painful to move my lower body... because I am getting out my lower body and I have a feeling that I may be having a heart attack!\nAny thoughts on what, if anything, to do the other days of your life, and I would be happy if your doctor would do for me a little less exercise on Saturday... I'm a bit overweight, my BMI is 27.7. I could probably have gone to the gym instead, but I am pretty sure that if I'm going to exercise on a normal scale, I ought to be able to. And since I already go to my exercise class - I can walk to the gym a couple of times a week, and my exercise class class was weekly, so I'm fine with doing the workouts once a week. I am trying to come out of it with what I can do for my heart. I will be able to do my exercise class, however, I am not going to be doing it very often (unless I start running), but I am really not going to stop exercising my other way!\nI just completed the first 800 units of the LCA. I have been thinking the program isn't only to rebalance my blood pressure, and not be able to manage my heart attack and high cholesterol. I can now exercise all day and get to the gym whenever it takes my mind off my high blood pressure, but even if it was 800, I would still be in the hospital due to my hypertension.

I was diagnosed with \"Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma with COPD\". Do you know what's the difference between \"COPD\" and \"chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\"?\nI did a bit of research online (I was lucky though!) and have found that \"COPD\" has a lot more people like me experiencing asthma like the symptoms of COPD (not the same as non-COPD). This is most likely because there's no'smoke-free' lung, so we can't use the symptoms to exclude someone with that condition from the group. So I also am not sure that we are doing enough research in the UK to exclude people with COPD from this group (not sure if there is a'smoking-free' group). You might also need to consider not having your asthma checked regularly.\nThank you for your question on this matter. We should be discussing it more in the near future. The above paragraph is only meant for you, and I do not have the answer to the question of \"How often should you have an asthma screening test?\" It depends on your own circumstances, and my own experience as a member of the Asthma UK community. I would have the asthma screening test every 6 to 12 months if my age is age related. If you are aged 11-18, you might take a one-off assessment once a year, but that's not usually necessary.\nIf you have been diagnosed with COPD, I would take a look at whether you meet the NHS breathing capacity criteria set for a COPD diagnosis - you can read about the criteria here but I do not have a direct calculation of what your breathing capacity is. The NHS says that a \"COPD\" diagnosis could be a result of a number/severity of COPD or lung function which is different from what most people would consider 'normal'.\nPlease ask your GP for an 'AED\" (Advanced Life Emergency Device, and its British equivalents, the AED-42/41 and AED-68) if you would like a breathing test but are too old to go into a hospital. If you qualify to do a test in hospital, you may be referred for the NHS and see an ECMO \"stay at home\" service as these \"oxygen therapy\" machines are now available in hospital. As long as you are under age 70, we don't consider you a COPD patient.", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\n\nAs to the \"cavities\", well, they're not a cavity, at least not in my opinion.

(Prevent and treat heart attacks and strokes, manage high blood pressure, cholesterol, or blood sugar levels)\n- Manage your diabetes. (Monitoring and treatment of blood glucose control)\n- Manage your cholesterol.

Did you focus on key risk factors?\nAt the beginning of this patient's treatment with drugs for heart failure (including 4th-generation ACE inhibitors and beta blockers), John's heart had a very low diastolic pressure (\u226450 mmHg) compared to 39-40 mmHg for a man of the same age and sex who had no chronic heart disease? Would John have been much better off with only the drugs you prescribed?\nAnd now that the drugs are finished, why is John's heart not on the list for cardioprotective benefits, and why does his age still make him a risk group? Is there an identifiable risk factor (which should have been a clear indicator of the impact that drug treatment had on his condition) that has nothing to do with the decision to be on the drug list?\nIn brief, John's age, his current medical condition, and the drugs he was recommended.\nYou've been told that if a person decides to stop on one drug for heart failure and does so with the guidance of a cardiologist, then that process needs to go via cardioprotective benefits \u2013 and if he is still on these drugs without any effect from the drug group he's on, then you could say that he is at risk of end-organ damage.\nWhat would such a person's heart rate be? Should they be a target for a prognostic test?\nA person's heart rate (or heart rate variation (HRV)) should be monitored by someone trained in ECG monitoring, and should be tested after every 10 minutes. There's a range of normal HRV from 0 to 150 beats per minute (bpm). The more frequent a person is doing HRV measurements, the greater their risk of heart failure.\nAt the point when a person does HRV measurements, there's nothing to suggest that the patient has an abnormal HRV.\nIt's worth noting that HRV may be affected by various health conditions. As an illustration, for more information on the significance of HRV, see John on this graph, and his HRV charts.\nHow was John\u2019s diagnosis confirmed in the context of the 1997 US/Canada guideline? Was he correct to think that the following was true?\nIn light of the heart failure diagnosis described above, John's condition would be 60-70% predictably reversible with ACE inhibitors and beta blockers and his age likely to have something to do with the heart failure diagnosis and his age with his cardiovascular risk factors, so John is at a very high risk for developing end-organ damage.\nWhat would you do with this info?\nYou can use this information to inform healthcare decisions and to promote decision making.\nWhat would you do with information that is already published?\nI have no interest in publishing recommendations of this nature \u2013 they\u2019re not published in an archive. Instead, I want to share information about drugs and lifestyle factors to promote healthy lifestyle choices and prevent CVD.\nWhat if John's condition was 50% predictably reversible and you identified the medication as a good contributor to the result?\nJohn\u2019s condition isn't very predictive of what we would consider an outcome of heart failure. And even if he was, the information would need to be shared with other persons with similar conditions to help make an informed decision.\nWhat is a useful feature of a prognosis diagram?\nA prognosis diagram \u2013 which provides the main picture that helps people decide on treatment \u2013 can help the decision maker decide whether to recommend something or not.\nThe topmost image depicts the prognosis of the heart, showing how the heart's function is affected by disease. The bottommost image depicts outcomes of the disease, showing how the outcome of the disease is predicted.\nWhen the top image represents what most people would experience from a 2- or 3-year prognosis (assuming that everyone would enjoy their life, and that people are not afraid to die of heart failure), the bottom image represents the outcome of the disease. That's where John is \u2013 since the heart is just a relatively young, strong and healthy organ, and the image tells us what we would expect to experience from a prognosis of that length.\nJohn\u2019s prognosis is at least a bit more difficult to predict than the bottom image. The bottom image should not be the only thing that is true of every person\u2019s prognosis for heart failure.\nAre heart failure patients aware of their own prognosis?

For this reason, I just read what Eunice Kennedy Shriver has to say... which I think you should consider as there are some important things being discussed and given a common denominator....\n\nThe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has recommendations for antihypertensive therapy\n\nBut, for your purposes, the \"good\" thing to have in mind is that if there is actually an actual risk involved and it is not due to cardiovascular risk factors (such as type II diabetes), you should avoid them, at least in this particular context - they are simply NOT part of your \"best\" therapy recommendation.\n\n\"A person who is healthy but has a heart ailment such as heart failure is at risk of putting themselves at heightened risk for cardiovascular disease. So what do I do?\"\n\n(This is a subjective subject to evaluate in my opinion), but I would generally treat them as a \"good\" target for treatment. The \"good\" thing to have in mind would be that if there is actual risk involved and it involves cardiovascular disease, and heart failure, as in \"you can't ignore the risk of heart disease...,\" treatment would be aimed at preventing or managing or treating the underlying cardiovascular disease.\n\nOtherwise, I would recommend doing what you would call non-stigmatizing treatment. Otherwise, this sort of treatment is often treated as more or less the kind of \"stigmatizing\" therapy of which I am aware, which makes it much harder to get people to seek out treatment.)\n\nRegarding the 10% reduction in mortality for people with heart failure - the \"best\" thing to have in mind is that we all know that heart failure cannot be cured, but we can manage its symptoms, and this is something that can be treated or managed. If you know that you are a heart failure patient, this is not something you must ignore. However, if you are a patient and it is something you know will not help (e.g., if this is a case of high blood pressure that is a risk factor, this is not to be given preference over the best thing to do, as that is not about treating or managing the underlying heart failure, but about treating this particular symptom of heart failure) you may be better off to treat people with heart failure as they come along because you know that they are going to benefit from treatment.\n\nIn your case, I would give the patients you treat some type of \"heart failure standard of care\". This is a simple guideline which says that patients with a diagnosis of heart failure should NOT be treated with medications which slow down or stop the heart from working. Rather, the person should be treated with lifestyle modifications (if possible), such as exercise. This kind of lifestyle modification can include a small reduction or a more moderate amount of drugs, as you would see in type II diabetes, or if you have an extremely high blood pressure that is a concern. It is also important to recognize the signs of heart failure. This includes shortness of breath even when they are not doing anything wrong and changes in heart rate, rhythm and breathing. Sometimes these are signs of something more serious. Treatment is a much better way to deal with the symptoms and side effects of heart failure, and you can learn a lot of information by working with an experienced heart failure specialist.\n\nOne of the important things that the public about heart failure should recognize is that it can occur in many forms - the 4 types (acute, subacute, chronic, and recurrent...) are not all present. This is partly because of the way the disease is \"diagnosed\" and treated: most often in the form of a type-specific drug (e.g., beta blockers or statins). The disease may develop slowly, and in patients with a poor prognosis; or it may show up suddenly, with all the effects, but without a clear diagnosis.\n\nThe most important thing to know about heart failure is \"when it's good and when it's not.\"\n\nYou should also be sure to focus the discussion on \"risk\" rather than \"suffering\" and \"health\" rather than \"disease.\"\n\nSome of you mentioned being at high risk of heart failure, which the heart failure population doesn't seem to be experiencing. However, it is not uncommon for someone at risk of developing heart failure to begin taking a high risk medication. For example, 50% of patients", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\n6. \"Fitness\" is used as a generic term for exercise\n7. CKD-DUH was first studied by David Fenton at Harvard and his successor Michael S. Fenton were both in 1972. Fenton's was a group of 22 patients, from a hospital in Houston who had died of renal failure. The study took place at the same time that Drs. Michael and David Kieffer were involved in the \"Fetch and Die Campaign.\"\n8. Dr. David Kieffer and his team at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center at Boston Hospital, who were among the patients who were eventually involved in the FEVURA study, used the same methods they employed to screen their patients. The main difference was that Kieffer used a simple, two-step screening instrument that included a list of specific questions (to identify any signs or symptoms of CVD): \"Does the patient have 3 of the following 4?\" For example, does he have any fever that doesn't cause cough or other chest discomfort?\n9. This technique can be modified to screen for COPD, and to screen for hyperglycemia, high blood pressure, and hypertension. A similar approach was used in the US to help identify low-carbohydrate vegetarians.\nFEVURA is a study of an elderly nursing home patient that compares the blood pressure of individuals with CVD using two criteria set by the Framingham Heart Study. The condition was defined as elevated blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or greater in 20 minutes. In 20 minutes, 279 patients with a systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 120/73 were followed-up by the team, as well as 464 patients who did not have a high blood pressure. Blood pressure change measurements revealed that the prevalence of CVD in the study population was higher in hypertensive patients (41 percent versus 27 percent of those without a blood pressure of 120/73).\nHowever, because the study subjects were aged 81 years or older, investigators concluded that the data were not relevant for the evaluation of the risk (and, later, its treatment) for individuals with a CVD as a result of having diabetes or obesity, so it was not possible to draw recommendations for any particular type of disease - despite the fact that there is evidence that high blood pressure is a common risk factor for CVD and therefore that controlling it, particularly in post-prandial settings, can prevent heart disease and, eventually, stroke.\nThe heart attacks of these patients also took place to the patients' age, so the doctors need to understand that people can have these conditions at any age, although risk increases with age. The results of the study were published in the journal \"Science Translational Medicine\" - and they showed that most of the patient group also had some degree of metabolic syndrome, with a positive correlation between the systolic blood pressure and the metabolic syndrome.\nThis also pointed towards the possibility that, in some people, high blood pressure might be associated with a heart attack, a result that may be \"obvious\" to the patient doctor. And perhaps even worse, the authors report that certain heart attacks happen after more than one heart attack, suggesting a relationship with one of the cardiovascular (heart) problems.\nHowever, patients with a blood pressure of 120/80 or higher had a lower risk of having a heart attack than those with a blood pressure of less than 120/70, while those with high blood pressure were not significantly at least 35 percent more likely to have a heart attack in every other case. It seems clear that this risk is related to another aspect of CVD - a higher risk of cardiovascular events. And it has to be emphasized, however, that not all studies have been able to establish a significant association between hypertension and CVD in younger people.\nThe heart attack could be related to one of the following factors:\n- a higher risk of CAD for an older person with diabetes than if the same adult in a non-diabetic or normal body weight without diabetes or obesity\n- increased risk of heart attack if a history of hypertension in the family\n- increased risk of heart attack if the condition also coexists with diabetes, and if diabetes is poorly controlled\n- increased risk of heart attack if any one of the following risk factors is present\nThe study team that carried out the analysis of the data did not specifically identify the reason, but it is clear that the heart attacks are", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\nAs the expert who's responsible for giving advice of CVD prevention to the NHS, I can see that you need to ask a lot more about your particular symptoms to find out if other changes \u2013 maybe you're a smoker - is enough to slow down your progression of disease. You might also want to learn more about your family's history and any possible genetic predisposition to heart disease, or know more about the lifestyle which may put you at greater risk of having heart failure, or that may put you at greater risk of developing heart disease down the line.\nHowever, it's even more important for you to consider that you might, in fact, be at least as much at risk of developing heart disease as a smoker - since it doesn't take a very long time to get heart disease or coronary heart disease.\nSo, should you still be smoking? Not if you're at high risk.\nIf you've decided to give up, it's only to reduce the risk of developing heart disease, not to stop completely even if you have decided to do the same. That's true even if you haven't smoked for a long time. If, in fact, you've taken up to four packs of cigarettes per week - which is the current smoking prevalence in China - then you'll probably get higher results. You'll be at a slightly higher risk if you're a smoker. For example, if you've been smoking for a year, that might mean you could live to be 85 or 86 by the time you look at your results.\nThe bottom line, though, is that the risk of developing coronary heart disease is significantly lower for both smokers and non-smokers than it is for moderate or heavy smokers.\nAlthough heart disease remains almost as high among people suffering from depression and anxiety as among smokers, there is still a significant difference. With the common feeling that a lot of depression or anxiety can be relieved by relaxation and a relaxation technique, such as meditation, that\u2019s true for many mental health conditions. Similarly, with that same feeling of anxiety or depression, those may feel they haven\u2019t been able to relax yet since that period when they\u2019ve been so over-stimulated. All these things can, in some way, be remedied by relaxation techniques.\nIf your depression or anxiety prevents you from spending time practising relaxation techniques, don\u2019t worry - there are a lot of resources on the Internet and books on various topics (including some on cardiovascular health) which have tips based on simple relaxation techniques.\nWhile you may not be as stressed as you\u2019d say you could be, there are things that still could be making you feel overworked and unable to do your job. However, you also still have some job-related sources of stress.\nPerhaps you work a half-hour long shift, working over the course of 12 to 13 hours a day. You have other duties to do all that day and the last hour of the shift is spent with friends and family. In addition to this, your health and the well-being of your family \u2013 especially your children \u2013 is at the forefront of your mind. You may also take a job that you don\u2019t enjoy doing \u2013 the work you find hard and unenjoyable.\nBut there\u2019s another way in which you could be doing your job. That is, you could take on a new line of work (especially one you don\u2019t enjoy doing or prefer not to do) and do it so well that those who are already employed in that line of work or in a related industry also would feel that stress of completing it satisfactorily. That\u2019s called \u2018resubation\u2019.\nResubation is a strategy to deal with prolonged stressors \u2013 such as those resulting from physical or mental health difficulties or work-related illnesses \u2013 by slowing down your working pace for a period of time and taking your duties more restful.\nAt least, that\u2019s an idea I think is worth thinking about. It\u2019s much more complicated than that, but a great read for any readers of this article.\nThe bottom line \u2013 as you move through life more steadily, it becomes easier to reduce your stress or worry levels during your current circumstances.", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\n\"The recommendations are for everyone, and we would like anyone who has such a high metabolic risk to have risk of CVD measured. If the results indicate that a condition such as obesity or being a smoker is associated with a higher risk in one part of the body, we would like to know if they found the same results for the face, for example, for the heart. A measurement can confirm that a condition is associated with a higher risk in the other parts of the body,\" explained Dr. Mark Walker, who reviewed the study and presented her results at \"World Academy of Medicine and Science Awards for Innovation\".\n\"It wasn't clear where we would measure for measuring that relationship. We wanted to know whether we could also be able to measure that relationship in blood in the same part of the body,\" said the study's lead author, Dr. Tuan Nguyen, Ph.D., of The Methodist Hospital in Texas. (Image: NICE)\nThe researchers compared data from three hospitals in Korea: Changwon Heart Hospital, Chungcheongnam-do Medical University, and Chungcheongnam University Hospital to examine CVD risk in Korea. The researchers collected data on 25,127 patients in the three hospitals using a standardized questionnaire.\nResults showed that patients between the ages of 50 and 59 years had a 17 percent chance of having a cardiovascular event, with the risk associated most with BMI ranging from 30 to 44.6. In the five other age groups, 36 percent of deaths were linked to diabetes or prediabetes. The risk analysis also revealed that women had a greater risk of heart disease.\nIn Korea, about 6 percent of men were estimated to have hypertension before the age of 45 years. Diabetes was strongly associated with the risk of mortality, and the risk for cardiovascular mortality was 1.2 times higher among diabetic men.\n\"We can see, therefore, that with our current prevalence of obesity and the use of mobile phone applications for information on cardiovascular and metabolic risk, we can find a relatively higher risk in the face of a heart attack or stroke,\" said Dr. Walker.\nHe added that there is not yet a standard screening approach for the diagnosis of CVD. Also, the risk of CVD in Koreans cannot be directly correlated with BMI. That means it should be more of a marker to look at general population factors.\n\"The information above seems to mean it's a useful indicator of CVD risk, a very good indicator if the result could be used as an indicator of CVD, and that kind of thing isn't that important. We can add a value to the whole. If 17 percent is so big, does it translate to another 14 percent to show that there is an increased risk of CVD or maybe a more severe heart disease to that of the non-Hispanic population and then there's a 3% risk of developing any sort of CVD? That may be reasonable in terms of that. We can consider that as a value,\" said Dr. Walker.\n\"Also, the fact that we don't know the exact cause, or the reason behind it, would be an advantage to me because I might find other things that could be involved. We need to know the answer to some of the causes that might be responsible for the development of cardiovascular disease to make treatment options. The more we know, the better.\"\n\"This is a useful piece of information of your risk. I don't want to jump into the question of whether you must have a treatment for CVD before doing a test, I'd be glad to check if that was something you tried and not a symptom of CVD. So to look and to know that you have CVD, or may have CVD, you might need to be evaluated or looked for more symptoms that may have been linked to heart disease,\" said Dr. Walker.\nShe and colleagues' study results were published in the journal \"Archives of Internal Medicine.\"", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\nThat's right! To quote Dr John Greenhow, in his book, A History of Medicine, it might refer to:\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one disease killer in the world, and the one that would make sense from an infectious and non-infectious perspective. As Professor John Greenhow famously put it: \"An infectious disease is the disease that is not directly transmitted from person to person.\" Heart disease and stroke, among them CVD, are both caused by non-communicable diseases, which are all of which have been extensively studied, but which we have no way of knowing if they can be cured or prevented.\nDr Greenwillow's account of how CVD develops and occurs in the human body was inspired by an article he wrote years ago, and he thinks it is still useful from an infectious and non-infectious perspective - he has a blog entitled: \"Methaprospheres\". This, of course, is nothing new to the medical community: we all have a methaprosphere, and if something similar occurs in other parts of the body, then it's natural to think of how that disease is acquired and then investigate whether there are any potential preventive measures. However, in the current pandemic, COVID-19 is a case in point. \"The pandemic is not just an epidemic,\" Dr Greenhow remarks. \"It's a pandemic, and every day, we are seeing an emerging epidemic at a time when new viruses are emerging. An emerging epidemic like COVID-19 is not an epidemic in isolation.\"\nSo what can we learn from the pandemic, from a microbiological standpoint, from a viral perspective?\nThe answer is: the most important lessons for COVID-19 prevention could be found in the human genome.\nHere are five things you can begin to do from the current pandemic:\n1. The pandemic is not an epidemic: The SARS-CoV-2 virus was not an epidemic in 2019 before an Ebola transmission emerged in the Democratic Republic of Congo, but since that time, Ebola has become the primary mode of disease transmission. So in fact, COVID-19 has not, on the face of it, posed any new risk to the global public health. SARS-CoV-2 is still an epidemic in Africa, but the pandemic is not an epidemic, and the virus in turn is not the only thing that is spreading quickly elsewhere around the globe.\nThis is something to note, because of what we know about the SARS-CoV-2 virus - both in terms of its relationship to other coronaviruses, and the different differences between individual strains of the virus - it is quite possible that the virus present in China was not the only viral form that was circulating there, but that it was also that of the novel corona virus. Therefore, to date, we know that the virus is not an epidemic in terms of transmission risk, and we have evidence that even when the virus from China did infect a relatively healthy individual in this new epidemic, its severity was far lower than it was in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.\nSo it is inescapable that the current pandemic, if it turns out that it is, in fact, an epidemic, is not an epidemic, and the virus will never become a new, widespread, and major public health issue as the corona virus does, although its prevalence can still be high.\n2. It is likely that the SARS-CoV-2 virus isn't a pandemic after all: SARS-CoV-2 is being transmitted between people every year in the US and China, but not every year. The first case of COVID-19 was in 2019, and, even if the SARS-CoV-2 virus we're talking about is now circulating in those countries, which means that it isn't \"pandemic\", that it will not appear as an epidemic in the future, it's just a case in point.\nThat said, COVID-19 is indeed important to consider in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic since a new virus has emerged. But the epidemic isn't necessarily, or even likely, just that. In fact, the pandemic is simply a change in the way we use our resources over time, and that is to be expected in most pandemics in terms of the number of people we use our resources to infect and spread. One key challenge ahead with any pandemic, it is likely to be, which is to control the spread of the virus: we have shown that once a virus has infected a massive population (by a", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD? Then what would it look like if the guidelines for cardiovascular disease prevention for John were 'appropriate'? How much higher in blood pressure of 115/62 mmHg would John need to have as opposed to those for a 19-year-old who still has diabetes? Does this fit the definition of CVD and what is your perception of the severity of John? Do you have any questions for John about hypertension or his BMI and blood pressure? Do you need to have a new set of prescriptions for John? Of course, if you ask 19-year-old John, he is at high risk for CVD and would likely require additional health precautions, because of his age and risk factors.\nAt this point, we have already answered John's questions as to how he was measured and calculated his blood pressure, blood sugar, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol. To help you to start making sense of this data, we created a quick guide called 12 Steps to Good Cholesterol. This guide will show you how to use the blood test data to figure out your cholesterol and to calculate your HDL -- that is the 'greatest' cholesterol; this is the key to having a healthy heart. It also shows you how to use the lab test results to calculate your heart disease risk so you can figure out the best way to improve your health, and to start taking proactive steps to prevent CVD/cardiovascular disease. This guide has been designed to be straightforward, but in addition to that, it has been written in a way that's accessible to the layperson with limited IT literacy. It contains a very simple chart or table that can be edited easily or viewed as a PDF file. It also includes two graphics, a 'checkmark' box to let you know that the graph above is what you should see on the graphic (it should be green), and a 'green' on the graph that should be off. As a simple example, consider this graph: -\n\"12 steps to good cholesterol: -\n- A 130/100mg/dl lipid level which indicates a high \"bad\" cholesterol level (\"atherogenic\") status, as measured by the 2005 National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) guidelines. - This value may be considered \"high\" because it is associated with a risk of heart disease, stroke, or other forms of heart disease. - For 100/140 mg/dl, it is considered \"very high risk.\" - Elevated cholesterol levels may be considered high risk because they are associated...\n- with an increased incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke or other fatal cardiovascular disease. - LDL (low density lipoprotein) cholesterol level (low to intermediate) describes the \"bad\" cholesterol that results from dietary fat and smoking. \u2013 High LDL cholesterol levels are associated with an increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, and heart failure. - Normal HDL cholesterol level (good) refers to total cholesterol levels that are usually over 40 and lower than 50. - A significant elevation of total cholesterol level above 179 mg/dl is considered abnormal. - HDL cholesterol levels over 50-60, are a strong indicator of overall risk...\n- in general, a low level of HDL cholesterol indicates an elevated risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), as measured by the 2005 NCEP guidelines for total cholesterol (below 230 mg/dl). - HDL cholesterol is associated with several risk factors for atherosclerosis: - - - - - - atherosclerosis, which is the buildup of plaque within arteries, most often inside the inner walls of arteries (arterial narrowing or stenosis or coarctation of the aorta). - - - - - - - \u2013 - - - - \u2013 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \u2013 - - - -\nThis guide is a small, practical presentation of the importance of this chart or graphic.

Those five are -\n- Avoid any activity that is linked to smoking - smoking can have a lasting effect on your health\n- The use of cigarettes (cigarettes) should be avoided. Smouldering tobacco should be kept in an individual tobacco collection, and the smoke from cigarettes should never be inhaled, unless it is heated by air. These are all risks to your health.\n- All tobacco users should be offered the means to give up cigarette smoking. This can be done through a smoking cessation service or counselling.\n- Nicotine is the addictive component of tobacco. It produces feelings of pleasure and enjoyment within a short time. There exists a physical risk and emotional risk of a tobacco user becoming dependent on nicotine. Nicotine is also the addictive substance in all other drugs.\n- The NICE Guidelines in smokers are that nicotine addiction does not have to become 'uncontrollably' active in the body. For this reason, they recommend never smoking again, even if it is not possible for you to quit.\nSome of the other recommendations from the Guidelines include:\n- Smoking can lead to developing smoking-related vascular disease\n- Using other tobacco products such tobacco gums, patches (nicotinic acid), smokeless tobacco, e-cigarettes (vape products) and modafinil (modafinil) may increase the risk of disease\n- Smoking is associated with the development of hypertension\n- Alcohol can significantly increase the risks of these other risk factors\n- Chronic alcohol dependency can cause heart disease and stroke\n- Smoking can harm the cardiovascular autonomic nervous system (slower autonomic nervous system activity)\n- There is evidence to suggest that long-term heavy use of alcohol can have an adverse effect on blood triglyceride levels\n- Tobacco consumption has been proven to be an important modifiable risk factor in type 2 diabetes. Using nicotine replacement products when smoking tobacco is not an option. Taking anti-smoking therapies when nicotine is no longer needed\n- The intake of tobacco in pregnant women must be reduced by an average of one cigarette a day, but when the pregnancy is over, and the person no longer smokes, the intake of nicotine by the person ceases. This advice is based on the NICE guidelines and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance, in pregnancy, at around 500mg a day.\nThe 2012 guidelines on CVD prevention, in brief:\nThe 2011 NICE guidelines on CVD prevention\nFor further detail on the CVD guidelines, visit their official website:"], "6": ["John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?

One of the recommendations with the highest level of evidence is for a healthy BMI and good HDL cholesterol. For a healthy BMI and good HDL cholesterol, I would not recommend a diet focusing on sugar-based foods, saturated fats, salt and refined grains. The Mediterranean diet also has a lower BMI and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This diet includes foods high in fiber, fruit, vegetables, fish, beans, and nuts.\u201d\nYour cardiologist recommends the following recommendations (with NICE guidelines for CVD):\nI would be highly recommend to have a complete medical history and blood pressure test\nIf my blood pressure is in the normal range, I would advise a diet based on high quality sources of fat (omega 3 fatty acids), particularly fish and fish oils\nIf my cholesterol and my total cholesterol are in the normal range, I would advise a diet based on high quality sources of fat (omega 3 fatty acids), as is the Mediterranean food\nIf my total cholesterol is in the normal range and my HDL cholesterol is well in my category, but my LDL cholesterol is high (hyperlipidemia), it may be necessary to take medication on a daily basis.

I felt that if I included more olive oil and walnuts in the Mediterranean diet, I would be more able to maintain good overall heart health and prevent the onset of cardiovascular diseases. I would also recommend a different Mediterranean diet to myself and my family. I would recommend a diet that has at least 50-percent olive oil and 40-percent nuts and beans, since both have Omega 3s.\nHave you eaten anything on the Mediterranean diet yet? I am curious about it, please tell me!\nA Mediterranean diet refers to healthy eating patterns from a combination of 3 different eating patterns and ingredients or elements rather than a single cooking style, such as the diet with olive oil, seafood, fruit and veggies like in the Mediterranean diet. These food habits, which are very well-known, seem to be beneficial for the heart in terms of cholesterol levels and cardiovascular health. Since these food habits are generally part of a balanced diet that includes the right amount of grains and fruits, one way to do is to enjoy these food habits as more than merely a way to get proper nutrition.\nAs we all know, the Mediterranean diet is characterized by:\n- Focus on salads, vegetables, and whole grains\n- Fruits and vegetables that have 70-80% of their fruit and vegetable intake including tomatoes, sweet peppers, eggplant, cucumber, melons, grapes, pears, peaches, and berries\n- Whole grains, nuts and beans, and fish and seafood\n- Nuts and seeds that do not exceed one-third of its energy intake (except nuts with 100% of its energy intake), and only eat one-third of their total energy intake after lunch, as lunch is an hour-long meal to keep you feeling full and energized, which are key ingredients in the Mediterranean diet\n- Low-fat milk products\n- Low-fat yogurt\n- Small portions of fish and shellfish\n- The use of olive oil and nuts, seeds, or other sources, such as legumes and nuts, in addition to other healthy foods\n- Moderate consumption of red wine, in moderation; this is another way to increase healthy eating habits from a dietary pattern, since the amount of wine that we drink plays a vital role in the cardiovascular health of a person\nIf you are unsure what the 5 natural health factors to achieve a healthy heart and maintain it is in your heart disease, keep checking these articles and bookmark this page.\nYour own cardiologist and family doctor recommends that you have the following food habits from a Mediterranean diet:\n- Olive oil\n- Seafood, poultry, and lean meats\n- Low-fat milk, dairy products, fortified soy milk\n- Whole grains, fruits, vegetables\nAs you can see, you will have a healthy heart and, in many cases, prevent heart problems.", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\nNICE guidelines for people with high blood pressure\nThis was written by Dr Michael Bove, Director, Cardiovascular Risk and Management (CRM), NICE in collaboration with Professor Andrew Ford. It is aimed at high blood pressure, which is the biggest killer of any country.\nIf you have been diagnosed with high blood pressure it means you have higher than healthy systolic pressure (the 'hard working' pressure, between the two ventricles, where the heart pumps blood) and your diastolic pressure (the 'loud pounding' pressure, between the heart in between two chambers).\nNICE recommends these simple but useful signs to watch for:\n- High blood pressure,\n- Heart palpitations,\n- Light-headedness, or\n- Shortness of breath when going from moderate/low to high, or back to low.\nThe Heart Foundation recommends these signs as a warning about a major heart event \u2013 heart attack, stroke or death. The five heart attack warning signs are listed in Tables 1 and 2, with the following heart attack warning signs also linked to cardiovascular disease:\n|A||Arms/Hands are stiff; chest pain; cold sweats; general aches without any obvious other symptoms; loss of appetite; cough; feeling like your heart is beating harder; nausea; indigestion. These are associated with heart disease and stroke.|\n|B||Fast pulse, weakness, light-headedness; chest pain or heaviness; chest pain with tightness; dizziness, faintness; fatigue; feeling cold, very cold; pain in the arms, neck, jaw, back or stomach that does not ease when you move around as you walk or stand or lie down.||These are associated with angina pectoris (chest discomfort or pressure) and heart failure.|\n|C||Shortness of breath, sometimes with exertion; chest pain; dizziness; light-headedness; tiredness; pain in the abdomen, back or sides; chest pain/pressure with exertion.\n|These are associated with angina and heart failure and are therefore not used to diagnose acute chest pain. They are also similar to chest angina.|\n|D||Shortness of breath, often out of time; fatigue; confusion; dizziness; loss of appetite; feeling cold, very cold; pain in the side; pain on pressure in the chest; nausea/vomiting. These are associated with angina, myocardial infarction (heart attack) and heart failure.|\n|E||Palpitations; rapid breathing; fast heartbeat; feeling a tight or 'tight' feeling on one side; difficulty speaking or swallowing; shortness of breath in the chest when lying down||These are associated with angina, myocardial infarction and heart failure.\n|These can also be used to diagnose chest pain and heart failure.

The majority of people who have a heart attack or sudden cardiac arrest do not have risk factors, yet the risk of dying from any cause is 15% if they have both cardiovascular disease and a cardiovascular disease-related condition such as diabetes or high blood pressure.\nWhat is good news?\nThis means, first of all, that most cardiovascular disease is preventable. Second, most cardiovascular disease is avoidable.\nWhat are your recommended CVD prevention interventions?\nWe do not recommend a total diet without exercise, and some of these recommendations include:\nEating at least five servings of fruits and vegetables, seven or eight servings of whole grains, three to five servings of low-fat or fat-free dairy foods, three or four servings of low-fat, low-sugar or low-fat, and eight or nine servings of lean protein.\nMost likely we need to be more aware of foods and dietary patterns that are linked with CVD. For example, research shows that a Mediterranean or at least Mediterranean-lean diet, where 125 grams of fish twice a week is consumed for about 6 years, reduces the risk of dying from any cause by 24%.\nWe also need to be more aware of foods and diet patterns that are associated with diabetes and CVD. We know that these risk factors are the result of dietary and lifestyle choices that are likely to be related and related health outcomes; thus, a number of recommendations include:\n- Eliminating trans fats, saturated fats, and all types of cholesterol to reduce your risk of heart disease.\n- Avoiding processed foods that promote coronary atherosclerosis and hypertension, such as sugar-sweetened beverages containing high levels of both, and sugary processed grains, especially refined carbohydrates, are good for prevention of other heart problems, including obesity, diabetes, and strokes.\nWe know the role of our gut microbiome, the bacteria that we naturally produce by eating our regular fare, and what they do, are important for our overall health, including our heart health. With that in mind, why is it important to address and address these gut microbiome issues with CVDs? Is it a good thing to focus on it and not stress about it? If a major body of scientific research supports it, will a program that focuses on this issue, including a program to train doctors on it, result in a significant cut in CVD, or a decrease in deaths from this condition by 10% for those who have a history of heart attack, die from any cause, CVD, diabetes or stroke?\nIf you have heard that 50% of a patient\u2019s diagnosis can be improved by nutrition, could you relate to our findings? Is that so relevant? We think so.\nA recent study by a university in Israel looked at the effect of nutritional interventions to prevent the onset of CVD as compared to placebo with a randomized control group and identified the most effective intervention on reducing CVD incidence, and found, for example, that eating a low-fat, Mediterranean-lean diet can reduce the incidence of stroke, and a diet like this is the most protective for CV development and survival in women. We know that these dietary and lifestyle considerations are among the most important health risk factors.\nWhat are the limitations of the study?\nIt has been difficult to identify and explain the main variables among those who were offered interventions. The most relevant one to the discussion is diet. For the sake of simplicity, let us define diet as 100 grams of fruit per day, or 100 grams of vegetables, or 200 grams of nuts and legumes per day, and a moderate amount of exercise such as walking after 30 minutes of exercise.\nFor more information on nutrition, try this site: http://www.mynutritionguide.com/nutrition-and-health.aspx, and read this article: https://www.forbes.com/sites/icaboo/2015/12/09/what-are-the-main-consequences-of-losing-weight-and-health/.\nI hope this article touches on the importance to prevent the progression to CVD, and our role in its elimination.\nDr", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?

Another is to discuss nutritional supplementation by a dietitian. There is no way to give you specific guidelines if you are diabetic nor can you give the patient any other guidance. Also, the patient is not going to ask questions directly, but rather a patient will come directly and ask questions and can make that informed decision, says Tewari.\nTo understand the implications of the diet, to know what we mean by 'nutrition' means of carbohydrate, fat and protein. A healthy person has an average intake of carbohydrate, fat and protein at 0.33 to 0.54% of their daily calorie needs. This is healthy, meaning the person requires 10% of the calories from nutrients. In a person with diabetes who is on a normal carbohydrate diet, a carbohydrate intake of 3.6 to 3.9 kg per day is needed. To understand the significance of carbohydrate in the diet, if someone is eating more than 3.9 kg per day is that very healthy? 25% to 30% of calories should come from carbohydrate? If you are eating four 1.5 kg meals per day is that too? 40% of your calories may be from carbohydrates, too. Does the person need carbohydrates, protein or fat? Yes, carbohydrates, protein and fat are all necessary for the body to repair and protect it, says Tuusula. In the case of carbohydrate intake, it is a good choice to go for complex carbohydrates, like oats or legumes (sardines and lentils), are better than simple carbs, like sugar and white flour, which have little benefit. However, in a person with diabetes, it is important to limit it, because if the person does not increase their fiber intake, diabetes can develop and the person develops complications like neuropathy (pain in the limbs), diabetes-related high blood sugar, the person can be obese, and a person with diabetes has a worse prognosis of heart related complications. For example, women should have 1.5% of their calories from fat, but women with PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) tend to have a diet high in fat and sugar, say the authors, and therefore need a diet where they can manage their diabetes. One should know that, even healthy individuals with diabetes must avoid a food high in fat if they have high blood sugar, says Tuusula.\nSuhail: You also need to make sure your diet is a healthy one, you can get information from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Website. And read \"American Diabetes Association's 2011 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\"\nTeya: I'm an independent clinical practice dietitian at a state-controlled hospital and I take the same diet as the author (Teece), but at that I'm actually working in a private practice. I do everything I can to help my patients.\nSuhail: Are they good for everyone?\nTeece: Well not every person is a diabetic patient; diabetic patients need to be educated about this diet. The best advice on this diet is that it is very low in carbohydrates and a lot of proteins. The body cannot handle so many carbs. The body breaks it down into sugar molecules, which cause no disease, says Tuusula. Protein is broken down into amino acids, which provide energy for the body, which can be used by the cells. Protein is also important in building muscles, says Tuusula.\nAnd that is also good advice from the ADA on this type of diet. Protein supplements are available for those who don't want to eat carbohydrates. But the patient should know the limitations, says Tuusula. It is really important that these supplements are used in combination with their carbohydrate intake. The carbohydrate should be included by itself, not in meals for at least 1.5 to 3 times per day.\nSuhail: The ADA is a group of more than 4,000 registered dietitians, who serve as representatives for doctors, hospitals, schools, schools and other public and private organizations.\nTeece: I think the ADA has a good and clear, very short and easy definition as it is about eating more healthy, not having too much or too a lot of things. They also take a very strong position in the diet as a whole, that it is very positive and has an important impact on people's health. They use their scientific authority to ensure this fact, that is", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?

In other words, look at all measures available and start implementing each one. So for example, take the weight; now, add in all other aspects of heart and CVD risk management (your high risk lifestyle, and your risk factors). Have a heart-healthy diet. Have a daily activity planner and exercise routine plan. See if you can reduce your blood-lead levels by 10% or 5%. A one-time-visit to the cardiologist is enough to bring your blood-lead levels below 40 \u03bcmol/L. You can also join a class to get your blood-lead levels checked or have a medical staff check at heart screenings at your doctor\u2019s office.

Heart, blood vessels, vision, kidneys, bones, and brain: These are the most important to us and have no relation to the general population of the United Kingdom (UK) and of the same age group. Heart and blood vessels: These are the most important to the general population of the UK. Eye and retina: If we were told to eat less sugary food for the eye health of the general population (e.g. diabetes), what should we eat and why? Blood vessels: These are the vessels in the body that are responsible is controlling the circulation of blood. The main ones are the arteries on the face (e.g. the neck) and veins to the limbs, but the heart and skeletal muscles are in the peripheral circulatory system. Kidney and brain: These are the vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to tissues. The main ones are the arteries on the face (e.g. the neck), veins to the limbs, but the heart and skeletal muscles are in the peripheral circulatory system.\nAll this is to say, the more we eat more, the more the food will be absorbed into the blood and the energy will be used and this creates the pressure of the blood pressure. When the heart is unable to function properly or at rest blood will flow in the wrong direction, and this pressure is created on the cardiovascular system and this will result in increased workload on the other organs and more work should be done to circulate the blood. A better understanding about these diseases might help the person to understand what he or she should eat or stop eating.\n- Type 2 diabetes: When the pancreas does not produce sufficient or no insulin in a case of diabetes, it creates a blood sugar (glucose), which does not have enough energy. The other complications of diabetes are heart and eye diseases. The main symptoms of this condition are the frequent need to go for appointments for appointments and the poor vision in the eye. These are the main blood sugar indicators for diabetes. The more the blood sugar levels are high, the more insulin resistance occurs on the body.\n- Obesity: This is a condition in which, the calories are not distributed in the correct way. The excess calories are burnt and the body stores it in the form of fat. This disease is very common in the USA, Britain, and the majority of the population. Obese people will have high cholesterol (cholesterol), increased blood pressure, high blood triglycerides (triglycerids) and obesity can lead to an increase in the formation of insulin resistance. These are the common features that people have to be worried about. The symptoms include loss of muscle mass, a slow and even slower metabolism and lack of appetite. The body does not look after the blood sugar levels because of which this disease occurs.\n- High levels of blood fat (hypertriglyceridemia): High cholesterol and triglyceridemia are two significant risk factors of heart disease and stroke. These are the leading causes of death and disability around the world. Blood lipids should be checked by people who have symptoms of high blood lipids. This is an important sign to know, and if you notice this condition the problem has been identified and treated properly. Treatment includes medication and lifestyle changes.\n- Diabetes mellitus: This is an increasing of sugar in your blood. The blood sugar should be less than 180 mg/dL. However, the sugar in the blood can be 250 and higher if the blood sugar is in the ideal range. There are several types of diabetes, so it is important to know which type of diabetes the person has (type 1 or type 2), so the treatment can be adapted to that type of diabetes. A person with type 1 diabetes uses insulin to keep the blood sugar in the optimal range. The two drugs which are used for diabetes are insulin or a glucagon (a hormone released by the pancreas). These drugs are responsible for creating the energy necessary for the muscles, skin and other organs.\n- Poor eyesight: This is a condition in which the eyes do not work normally. A high level of blood sugar will not allow you to convert visual energy into sight. The diabetic eye should be tested through the retina as early as possible. A diabetic eye test helps in the diagnosis of blindness from diabetic eye disease.\n- Multiple sclerosis: The autoimmune disease is very common and is characterized by the destruction of nerve cells leading to a loss of muscle sensation, numbness on most of the parts of the body, vision loss and the loss of ability to use a language, hearing, moving limbs and feeling.\n- Rheumatoid arthritis: If the immune system is involved", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\nQuestion on a patient with a family history of CVD (cardiovascular disease), the patient is a man 55 years of age and is in his twenties.

The patient has a healthy history of a diet with the recommended daily intake of vegetables comprising about 1.4 serves per day for males and 1 daily serves per day for females.\nThe patient has been followed regularly for 2 years. The patient has been to a cardiology specialist for a cardiac angiogram and angiogram reports. The patient was recommended to have 1800 g of carbohydrates per day (as carbohydrates may be taken up more readily by the body in a calorie deficit) but he is advised by his doctor to reduce this. This is part of his lifestyle and has been observed to be relatively healthy and in reasonable agreement with the recommendations of NICE.\nWhich health promotion intervention would you recommend?\nThe patient should have an increased intake of vegetables as a dietary intervention. This reduces the risk of coronary artery disease, as the vegetables are not digested and the amount of nutrients taken up by the body is of less nutritional value. The additional daily dose of carbohydrates (5 per day) may be achieved by adding to a typical Western diet or by increasing the amount of a low carbohydrate food (eg whole wheat or brown rice) offered.\n- Cardiovascular diseases, heart disease\n- Diabetes mellitus type 1\n- Diabetes mellitus type 2\n- Heart attack\n- Atherosclerosis (scar-forming)\n- Coronary heart disease\n- Heart failure\n- Peripheral neuropathy\n- Renal disease\n- Renal artery stenosis\n- Vasculitis and vasculopathy\n- Pericarditis and pericarditis", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\n- He is diagnosed with type 1 diabetes before the age of 40 years.\n- The patient is 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 59 kg and the waist circumference is more than 80 cm\n- He has an HDL cholesterol greater than 5 mmol/L (18.2 mmol/L if he is borderline hypercholasemia, 13.9 mmol/L if he is hypercholasemia, 7 mmoz of ldl and 1.3 mmol/L if he is hypoglycaemic)\n- He is diagnosed with hypertriglyceridemia when taking an insulin level of 100 mg/dl or higher\n- The patient is diagnosed with hypertriglyceridemia when taking an insulin level of 100 mg/dl or higher.\n- The patient is diagnosed with hypertriglyceridemia when taking an insulin level of 100 mg/dl or higher.\nNice to ask you in the next 30minutes. For some reasons not all people in the world have equal access to care, but we need to have a universal approach. In most cases, with an African population, the primary care provider is a public health care institution where there is a social or economic constraint to access health care. Many regions of Africa have a shortage of nurses and midwives. In other African countries, the lack of health facilities, especially without access to proper and sustainable, clean water supply and sanitation facilities, leads to an increase in the prevalence of HIV/AIDS and various other life threatening diseases.\nThe problem of high and persistent hyperlipidemia as well as high blood sugar is a growing problem. It is expected to increase in Africa. It is estimated that by 2030, an average in Africa will have 9.4 people suffering from hyperlipidemia and another 100,000 people with high blood cholesterol.\nIn addition, in 2016, a report by WHO indicated that diabetes affects one in three adults in the region. If it were not for our health care, we would be living in a nation where one third of the population will get the disease.\nLet me see if I understand it this way. Let us put those numbers in a similar order. We have 263 million people on chronic disease, 64 per cent of them will die in the next decade, the WHO estimates it, that we are still way off. The problem will only get worse if we try to change all the practices.\nWe are trying to change the habits or behaviors that have led us to this point. Many people are going to have to try to live with the lifestyle. It is important that the health and the management of the disease are being promoted by a team that we all know as the health workforce. The health workforce can be divided into frontline health workforce in the health areas that we are addressing and non-focal health workforce that we work with. The non-focal health workforce includes our primary care workforce, community care workers and medical workers. If we want the general public to want to live longer and live healthier lives, we need to continue giving them the health benefits that we have been providing them for years to serve as an example.\nWe need to be teaching people to look after their body because you want your body to be healthy, this is not just about us, the health of the people around us, the health of the animals too. We need to be teaching them that we will die if we don\u2019t look after our health and we need to be teaching them that we will die if we don\u2019t care for our health, not just ourselves. There must be an incentive to us to look after our health and the health of others, it is something that we have been doing since the birth of humanity. When I was a child, children ran around the house barefoot, the adults would use the mud on their shoes and the children walked barefoot. They walked barefoot. When it comes to diabetes, diabetes is a progressive disease. We cannot just stop growing old, we cannot just let people grow old. It is a chronic disease that will progress until we die. People need to have a clear vision about the disease. They need to know that this disease is progressive and that the disease will progress until it is too late.\nNow, I am not saying that we could not see there were some of our patients who were so unhealthy that they died, but I am saying that it is important", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\nTo that end, an expert panel of 20 cardiologists from 20 UK medical and cardiology specialties reviewed the evidence and devised a set of guidelines. All the guidelines recommend the following four recommendations:\n- A balanced and heart-healthy diet (sauces, sauces, baked goods, dairy, and other types of fat, refined carbs such as pasta, refined grains, and soft drinks, or less)\n- Exercising regularly, ideally for 30 minutes 5x a week (moderate/good intensity activity like walking, cycling, or swimming), and, if possible, 2 fitness classes such as weight lifting every week by using appropriate equipment.\n- Counselling to improve diet and habits\n- Medication if needed\nThe research on this recommendation is still up for debate! A recent study in the Journal of the European Heart Journal has found 81% of 400 patients with CVD from 187 different centres had a low blood pressure of less than 90/66 mmHg even though they had taken blood pressure medication at baseline without any other major symptom. Only 81% had a normal cardiac output after a five-year follow-up.\nWhat this study is saying is that patients with major CVD complications, including myocardial infarction (MMI), heart failure, or death, need to follow their recommendations if they are at high risk of major heart attack or CVD. These risks can be caused by many factors including:\n- a poor diet high in fat and lack of physical activity\n- genetic, behavioural, environmental and other factors\n- a previous cardiac event (MMI or heart disease)\nIt is also interesting to note that the researchers included patients with no evidence of a cardiovascular event on the cardiovascular risk score \u2013 suggesting CVD may be underdiagnosed in patients with no signs of cardiovascular disease.\nIn summary, if your heart is damaged or destroyed by cardiovascular disease, the next step is to take action to lower your risk of cardiovascular events and improve the quality of your life. You can do this by changing your way of eating, moving more, getting enough exercise, and reducing your stress level.\n- The NHS \u2013 Cardiology: Heart Health and Cardiovascular Risk\n- NHS \u2013 Myocardial Infarction: What to know (13 October, 2017)\n- 4 Tips to Lower Your Risk of Heart Disease (05 September, 2017)\n- 10 Things That Make Your Heart Healthy (23 May, 2016)\nIf you are a health professional or have a clinical question or comment, please contact us.\nVisit our Community of Care Service pages for advice on how to improve your medical and other professional support.\nThis article was provided by MedShare\u2019s Content Manager.

He has a 12-13 p.m. bedtime because of the stress of job. He would benefit from a treatment plan that would include a healthy diet and exercise, stress control, smoking cessation, weight loss by reducing excess weight and using the 7-day plan to create a plan he can stick to.\nQ. How do I interpret a heart rate reading?\nA. A healthy heart rate (HR) is 70 to 85 bpm, although some people have higher or lower HRs. It is not only an indicator of how well the body is working, but also your stress level. While exercise, stress and caffeine are great for improving HR, moderate exercise should not be excluded, as well as a healthy diet and lifestyle. Heart rate is usually the first number that physicians look for and can be taken as a general reading.\nQ. When I am over the age of 60 (I am now 62 years old) am I at risk for heart disease?\nThese are just a few examples. While heart attacks, strokes, peripheral vascular disease and other types of heart diseases are a much larger problem in the general population, there are many types of disease that are not seen in most seniors. Even when there are symptoms associated by older individuals, there are not many symptoms of heart disease. For women, men become heart disease risk factors at 40 years of age before the risk of stroke is even raised. When you age, many of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease become much less pronounced. If you need new exercise and a heart healthy diet or are worried about your heart disease, ask your doctor for a simple blood test. If you need help finding support, a national hotline is available as well as a patient safety hotline.", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\n1: Take a physical examination.\n2: Make an appointment with a cardiologist/panditional cardiologist, if it is an issue for you.\n3: Your doctor will first examine your overall health and risk factors in collaboration with other medical tests. Together you can make a plan to prevent the health conditions that may run in your family from progressing.\nWhat factors, such as age, sex and ethnicity, should influence the decision to have genetic counseling or genetic testing?\nA genetic panel will determine the type of genetic test you need. You will be referred to a genetic counselor/panditional specialist who will be able to prescribe genetic counseling.\nIn which age group does the need for genetic risk-prediction testing exist?\nAlthough most patients with high genetic risk-prediction testing are older than 55, 16% of patients between 35 to 44 have an increased risk of developing CVD related to age in relation to the risk of developing the condition later in life. If a patient is considered at a high risk, they should consult with a genetic counselor.\nThe reason for this increased awareness of risk-prediction testing is due to the availability of genetic tests. Which of the following is not a type of genetic test?\nDNA testing; in some clinical situations, a genetic test may exclude disease that are not genetic in origin.\nThe risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) increases with age. This means that the risk of developing CVD before age 55 is no longer limited by a family history of CVD. However, patients with a family history of CVD are at increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease once they are 70-years-old. When choosing between a genetic risk-prediction test and other risk assessment tests, consider the age at which you are at greatest risk of developing chronic disease.\nWhich of the following is not a genetic term that you should be familiar with?\nAtopic dermatitis is not a genetic cause. Atopic dermatitis is an inflammatory skin condition that is primarily caused by environmental factors.\nWhat are the main elements of a healthy diet?\nVegetables and fruits. The majority of fruits and vegetables should contain 6-8% fat. This fat is the kind found in fatty fish [3,4], olives [2,5], nuts [2,6,7], cheese [8,9] and milk products [2,10].\nWhat are 6-8% (average) of fat found in plant-based foods?\nPulses, legumes, nuts, grains.\nHow many carbohydrates are found in a variety of plant-based foods?\nThere are some excellent studies that examine how the percentages of carbohydrate in the diet relate to the risk of heart disease. They report similar findings: higher percentages of complex carbohydrates (carbohydrates with a higher number of carbohydrate molecules and a lower carbohydrate glycemic index), lower saturated fat and cholesterol intake and lower saturated fat intake and cholesterol intake were found to be effective in lowering the risk of heart disease. (See the fact sheet \u201cCarbohydrates and Heart Disease.\u201d)\nIs carbohydrate deficiency (dietary low in carbohydrates) a risk factor for developing atherosclerosis?\nNo. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammation of the artery wall due to poor diet.\nHow much saturated fat do we get from animal foods?\n5 grams/100 grams.\nWhat is saturated fat?\nSaturated fat is a type of fat that we find under a wide range of names. It is one of the worst forms of fat that we actually ingest as a result of food consumption.\nIs dietary energy derived from saturated fats the same with all types of fat?\nFat intake derived from saturated fats is different from that found in hydrogenated fats which is a man-made product in foods.\nWhat is the cholesterol-free fatty acid formula?\n\u201cThe formula indicates the optimal amount of dietary fat to which we should not have to limit. Because an amount of fat that does not constitute cholesterol contributes only to the reduction of LDL, this is used to denote the level in which you maintain a low cholesterol level.\u201d\nWhat is low cholesterol?\nLow cholesterol levels refer to not having or having a very low level of total, LDL, and LDL/HDL cholesterol that will reach 3.0 or more. If your total cholesterol is below 200, LDL has a very low range that will reach 1.70 and HDL has a very high range that will reach 2.40.

He is 44 years old. His first event is a mild angina on an 8.0 mm Hg left charge; his second event is an event at 71% RBF 4.1 min. This event triggers a subsequent second event only. He now expects to have 5 additional attacks within six months. At that point, the second event triggers a subsequent third event with a subsequent third attack. These event triggers a fourth and fifth event (80% RFB within 8.0 minutes).\nIf you are the referring clinician for this patient, what should they do?\nJohn's NICE guidelines\n1. The treatment of the first event should be the same as for previous events. In addition, all episodes should be supervised and supported by a specialist in coronary heart disease. The focus of intervention should be to maintain and improve the function of the heart, to keep the heart functioning, and to prevent or minimize future events. This treatment should focus on preventing subsequent events from happening by limiting their progress to a manageable level as far as possible.\n2. The target of the second event is to stop one and prevent another within the next 6 months or for patients with no or uncertain risk factors. For patients with known risk factors, the focus of intervention should be to achieve a less intensive level of control over the risk of future events and maintain or improve their cardiac function within a better than feasible progression curve.\n3. The target of the third event is sustained control over all three attacks over at least a period of three months, to improve the functional capacity of the heart, to control symptoms, and to extend life expectancy. The prevention of a third event should be limited to a period of 3 months to 1 year. However, the target of the fourth event should be to achieve satisfactory control within a progression curve within three months to 1 year.\n4. The focus on maintaining a target of a reduction of heart function after a first attack is important to prevent further events, especially after a second attack.\nA 49 year old female presents for a clinic visit in which there is a previous history of 5 sudden deaths due to a transient cardiac arrhythmia. The patient has had 3 previous acute heart attacks and had a 10-year history of 1 fatal coronary revascularization and a non-fatal heart attack. She is 35 years old. The previous event occurred at the peak interval of her clinical condition, although the risk of future events has been reduced by the current anti-emetic treatment. How would the previous history and current management be best managed for her?\nA 49 year old woman was admitted to a hospital complaining of chest pain for 4 days, with 2 major cardiac causes. The symptoms consist of dyspnea, tachycardia, and low blood pressure, and she is in excellent condition, has no evidence of cardiac disease, and no history of angina or arrhythmias. The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction can be made only by an electrocardiogram on at least 2 other days.

Signs and symptoms of a myocardial infarction occur for 3 days immediately before the attack, followed by prolonged attacks of dyspnea on exertion until she becomes ill. The patient's clinical history suggests a history of smoking from her last 2, 3, or 4 years since obtaining her smoking history. Her physician suspects that she has a first coronary revascularization. She is an attractive young young woman with no health history.

Discuss.\nAns. The guidelines can be grouped into 4 main categories based on the type of CVD associated with a cardiovascular risk:\n- Lifestyle :\n- Healthy lifestyle, such as quitting smoking, reducing calorie and fat intake, healthy weight, and physical activity level.\n- Medication :\n- Patients who need additional medicines for diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.\n- Medical conditions related to heart disease, such as high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol levels, and abnormal heart rhythms.\n- Medical causes of CVD:\n- Cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attacks, strokes, coronary artery disorders.\n- Inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and psoriasis.\n- Psychological disorders like depression and anxiety.\n- Endocrine conditions, such as Graves' disease or Addison's disease due to adrenal hormones.\n- Medical interventions:\n- Heart valve surgery and bypass surgery, artificial heart valves, and drug therapy for coronary artery disease.\n- Cardiac catheterization and angioplasty.\n- Endovascular procedures:\n- Angioplasties, stenting, and valve replacement.\n- Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n- Aortic balloon angioplasty\n- Catheter angioplasty\n- Angioplasty & stenting:\n- Percutaneous coronary intervention:\n- Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG):\n- Rivascular artery bypass graft (RABG):\n- Peripheral vascular access (PVA):\n- Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/ACE inhibitors:\n- Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/ACE inhibitors:\n- \u03b2 blockers:\n- Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/ACE inhibitors\n- Angiotensin receptor blockers:\n- The guidelines generally focus on lifestyle adjustments or medical interventions when necessary, while medications are generally used to treat non-lifestyle diseases. The NICE guidance also outlines specific clinical parameters and clinical guidelines for CVD risk management in different age groups, including for patients under 85 years of age and for patients 45 \u2013 64 years of age.\n- The guideline does not recommend lifestyle modifications for patients older than 65 years, regardless of their health condition. For patients 45 \u2013 64 years, NICE guidance focuses on managing health conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or cardiovascular disease. However, the guideline advises the management of CVD patients in this age group only, depending on their health condition.\n- The guideline provides comprehensive guidance for patients under 45 years of age, regardless of their health condition.

At that point, I look at your GP history to see if you are a risk factor for heart disease. So if you are, then your GP may review your diet, give you advice on how to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol, and give you advice on lifestyle if you are not, I am generally more hesitant when it comes to prescribing treatment.\nI am a GP who I work with has been treating a number of people and, I'm also involved with our Family Nutrition program in Australia, and I've worked with most of them for a number of years. I also work with the community in Australia, and I've worked with a number of people who have been developing their health in a number of different ways over the past few years to better themselves. So, I've dealt with a number of people, and not the only people, but certainly a number of people who are more susceptible to CVD than I would like. I haven't seen any of these in a very long time, but a lot of cases of CVD are genetic in nature. We have some new guidelines for CVD risk management that are being introduced in Australia, which is in line with the recommendations of NICE. So, that's pretty much the whole gamut of CVD prevention.\nBut I think this would be quite a big deal because there are those things that we simply cannot control, and so there'd be those people that are at very high risk of developing a CVD and can easily be persuaded to change those things as well. If they were more physically active than sedentary, if they were not smoke-free, if they were not overweight and had a family history of CVD, I think those would be some of the more common individuals who are at risk of developing a CVD.\nSo, there's a real stigma around CVD research and, in my view, the NHS has been reluctant, but if we could reach people now through an education program we think we would get people to think about that when they say, 'Oh, I heard of this thing, I can stop smoking now.' If CVD prevention can be done without the need for any treatment or pharmacotherapy, then people would want even more treatment for their heart disease and for their CVD.\nAnd I like that idea of education. The way that we would get people to work alongside a CVD risk management program is, people would want to be involved more. And I think that's the big picture of the idea of the NHS getting involved.\nI think we would get more people talking about what is important and what doesn't really matter in the treatment of CVD. There's some evidence that the way to fight heart disease and control or prevent all of these other risks are to start changing your diet and your lifestyle, right? What is it? Can you change it? Can you stop smoking and make a lifestyle change? Can you take medication when you're diagnosed with high blood pressure or high cholesterol? I think that's what the NHS is going to be doing and will be able to help the public to try and get themselves or their children to do that. In many cases people simply can't change their own way of being in the world. So, in many cases people are going to need to be involved with the NHS and participate in a CVD risk management program.\nI am delighted that the NHS is trying to do that, I really believe that, but I think the role of the public is to be involved in the research and to be a part of this process. But I think that the way the NHS does their work in controlling or preventing CVD, and not just the people who diagnosed it, and doing it in a way that doesn't make", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?\nWhat is the recommended cardiovascular disease risk for an individual in the US living in a retirement home?\nIt is recommended that the individual take an active role in his/her personal well-being, including an ongoing commitment to exercise and get enough sleep without caffeine or nicotine. This is most important in a senior\u2019s retirement home and when life brings about retirement. At least 8 hours of sleep a night.\nA person is recommended to follow these suggestions:\nLimit alcohol intake to no more than 2 drinks a day and 1 drink per day of alcohol, or more than 2 drinks in a day for men, and more than 1 drink in a day for women.\nReduce their diet to no more than 5 servings of fruits and vegetables a day.\nLimit saturated and trans fats.\nIt is advised to meet health criteria\nThe health criteria is the minimum age limit for entering into a retirement home. When considering the age criterion, the individual is advised to consult with their doctors before pursuing retirement.\nIt is recommended to consider the individual\u2019s health criteria as well as retirement health criteria for the retiree\u2019s decision.\nSeniors are advised to have at least 7-8 servings of fruits and vegetables a day and at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables of at least 5 servings of fruit.\nThis will help maintain good nutrition and also increase their chances of staying healthier due to the low intake of alcohol and the intake of unsaturated fats. This way reduces the risks of developing heart disease and type 2 diabetes. It is recommended for retirees, especially those who are elderly, to continue consuming moderate levels of alcohol for at least 2 glasses of wine per day, 500 ml of red and white wines, and moderate intake of processed food and desserts, for an adult who is 71.5 years or older.\nIt is recommended for those who are elderly to continue consuming moderate levels alcohol for 2 glasses of wine per day, 500 ml of red and white wines, but moderate intake of processed food and desserts, for an adult who is 71.5 years or older.\nThose who are aged 70 years and above are advised to continue consuming moderate levels of alcohol for 2 glasses of wine per day, or 600 ml of wine, and moderate alcohol intake for the 5 to 17 hour session, or 100 ml of wine each. (100 ml = 8 oz)\nThe individual is encouraged to consume more health foods if they have higher BMI and are older at the time. It is recommended that individuals remain active and engage in health activities such as walking, jogging, cycling, gardening, and any other activities as advised by their health care provider.\nThe individual is also advised to eat a balanced diet from different food groups such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and fruits and vegetables.\nFats must be non-hydrogenated, and be of healthy quality and content.\nA healthy diet should include non-hydrogenated oils. These include olive oil, canola oil, ghee, and nuts. The person is advised to reduce fats that have a high sugar content.\nMost dietetic professionals believe that the recommendations are only based on research.\nAll people are advised to limit alcohol consumption and to avoid smoking cigarettes.\nFruits and vegetable consumption should be at least 5 servings a day, with no less than 2 servings of fruits and vegetables of at least 5 servings a day.\nThe individual is advised to limit his or her intake of alcohol as advised by the individual\u2019s doctor. Alcohol must be consumed in moderation.\nAccording to some studies, there is conflicting evidence that smoking may be protective against heart disease, but this data is not without controversy. However, it may be wise to consider smoking instead of drinking in a retirement home for at least 2 to 4 hours, or for a longer duration of time. This is the number of cigarettes smokers take.\nIf the individual has a family history of cancer, heart disease, or is aged 70 years and above, the individual is advised to avoid smoking.\nIt is recommended that the individual avoid smoking for 30 minutes if they are exposed to secondhand smoke or see someone smoking.\nThis may be recommended if the individual lives in an age-restricted area with limited access to smoking.\nIt is recommended that the individual avoid smoking for 10 minutes in a public place, such as at the grocery store. This could be 20 minute if at home with close family members.\n", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?\nThe NICE guideline is for the management of CVD risk:\n- Individuals at increased risk must be enrolled (defined as those 65 years or older, obese), and they must have access to interventions in their community, such as nutrition counselling, community and family consultations, or an intensive exercise program using a combination of the most important lifestyle modifiable risk factors \u2013 eating less red meat, limiting alcohol, and increasing physical activity. However, it cannot be used for those who have high genetic markers and for those who have had a diagnosis of a cardiovascular or neurological disease, or for low socio-economic status;\n- The interventions should be offered at the point of diagnosis.\nHow many NICE guidelines are there?\nThe NICE guideline is for the management of CVD risk:\n- Patients with diabetes or those aged 65 years or above are all eligible for the intervention;\n- If this intervention doesn't seem to be going well, referral to other specialists is recommended.\nThe aim is that all patients, regardless of their age or the level of risk, see their GP or cardiologist.\nWho is eligible for the intervention?\nPatients with a diagnosis of CVD or a positive risk factor for CVD (such as diabetes) are referred to the NICE guideline. Individuals aged 60 and over and those at high genetic risk of CVD (either as per the above NICE guideline or if they have had a positive diagnosis of a CVD, including stroke) are eligible for the intervention. Individuals with diabetes are referred to the intervention if they have a positive glucose index or a glucose tolerance test. Those who have had recently a stroke are also expected to be eligible for this intervention. On admission to these guidelines, they have a 95 per cent chance of progressing to the next level and therefore all patients diagnosed as above are treated. At the point of diagnosis they are still monitored to ensure their condition is stable. Patients who don't meet the criteria for the intervention are not referred for this.\nWhat happens at the intervention?\nPatients with a suspected case of CVD, but no diagnosis are referred for a screening. During the screening, a thorough and detailed review is undertaken, including assessment of blood pressure, blood lipids, cardiovascular risk factors, blood oxygenation state, and the general physical condition. Patients are asked if they have recently been diagnosed with a diagnosis of an CVD or to have a fasting lipid measured prior to the intervention. The patient is then assessed if the patient is at high-risk of developing a CVD.\nWho is the patient who has to be screened?\nIn the intervention, a group of clinical experts assess and manage the patient.

No risk: This is when an individual is considered as unlikely to have CVD. They are considered at risk of CVD and could be referred for an annual check-up if needed.\n- 2. A limited risk that is unlikely to occur: This is the individual is relatively unlikely to have a stroke, heart attack, or any other blood clot related event. They are also classified as at highest risk as they likely are unlikely to have those risk factors.\nThere is no specific time for the person to take aspirin. They should aim to take 8-16 days of daily aspirin on a low- to moderate-dose, as recommended by NICE guidelines.\nThey require careful monitoring to see that they have at least 800 mg of aspirin per day (25mg every two to three hours during the day).\nThe daily dose is 500mg per day, ideally. But the person could potentially take more if they needed it.\nPeople with coronary artery disease may get a thromboembolic event. They are treated with thrombolytics, which can be given by injection or by mouth.\nThey are given 30 to 90 minutes immediately after the attack or 30 minutes later and again after a further treatment. This can help to make the next attack easier for the patient.\nPeople with stable coronary artery disease may receive the drugs simvastatin and pravastatin.\nThey are given this at once, even if they didn\u2019t notice a problem during the initial treatment. If they do, their risk of having a future heart attack or stroke is significantly reduced.\nIn this case, there is no need to check the numbers before starting the injection, but if there is a chance of there being someone in a dangerous situation, it\u2019s best to check the safety level on the injection.\nWhat is the effect of the injections and dose?\nThe injections have a safety level at around 200%. Since the drugs have low or zero risk, the doctor will provide the dose and time between each injection to make sure they don\u2019t cause unnecessary risk.\nThe dose to get a benefit is 200mg every five minutes for eight weeks or 300 mg once a day if no attack occurs.

This is a significant increase from the rate that the cost for the NHS has increased over the last 50 years, which accounts for a 31% rise between 1970 and 2005. When comparing this to the national healthcare spending we should expect to see rates of over 60% increase in healthcare. In many countries the costs of the healthcare system is also rising.\nIn 2010 and 2011 the NHS spent ~$175 billion on health care \u2013 about 20% higher than the total annual population expenditure on health care (WHO, 2012). It appears that the current growth will continue to increase health-care costs in both these countries.\nIs it possible to stay alive despite poor health?\nIt is difficult to say what effect will the health system have on people\u2019s"]}
