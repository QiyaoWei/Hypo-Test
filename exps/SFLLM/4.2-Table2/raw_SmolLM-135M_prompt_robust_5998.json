They are just trying to get their blood sugar under control for their own benefit, which is fine. They can do regular checks, and in no case can they be a real risk to their health. They will also need to monitor their cholesterol level, because in general LDL and HDL, their blood and heart levels may be very high.\n\nSo in conclusion, I just want to make sure that their family members and friends can do this for their own benefit to ensure that the person who is getting treatment for diabetes and CVD can only do so with the right level of care based on what they are already doing and not their BMI level, blood pressure level, etc. I would then recommend that they see their GP and get their blood work checked again in six weeks as a way to assess how well they are doing managing the person's health and being compliant with the guidelines to ensure that their condition is getting treated, not worsening.\n\nNote: This suggestion has now been implemented by my GP and their GP's team, and they are the ones going to follow up on the patient and follow up their advice on how they should manage their healthcare and continue to monitor their blood sugar level to see if their blood sugar goes down a little, because this is not the first year they have had this situation.\n\n\u2022 If someone can follow up with my GP (if they have a plan somewhere, that would be great, even if they are self-employed), I would be happy to hear how they would feel about following up with my patient and if their GP has done the best to ensure that they get the right care. \u2013\u00a0Mike Sep 9 '16 at 11:58\n\nChest pain, fatigue, muscle and joint pain.\n\nDiabetes =\n\u2022 \"diabetes which is not well controlled\" =\n\u2022 \" diabetes that requires a careful analysis of blood sugar (glucose) levels, as well as insulin levels\"\n\u2022 \"diabetes that increases risk of stroke\" (also known as, \"neuropathy\" - \"nerve neuropathy\")\n\u2022 \"severe nerve damage\" =\n\nThe signs of CVD also fall into the same categories.\n\n\u2022 Pain - \"Pain where the person is physically injured\", pain when moving or lifting certain material, pain as a result of blood clots or leg ulcers, pain when you're moving, or are lifting something, pain when you're walking, or when you feel pressure or tightness, pain around the spine when sleeping, severe neck pain, back pain, back pain from bending, or knee pain.\n\u2022 Fatigue -\n\u2022 \"fatigue\" is usually a lack of energy and lack of interest in doing ordinary activities.\n\u2022 \" muscle and physical function\" are both muscle or physical function, and muscle fatigue (see above) is often associated with fatigue.\n\u2022 Skin Problems - \"skin conditions\" are often caused by diabetes, which can lead to serious or life-threatening infections.\n\u2022 \"Cardiovascular\" symptoms - \"severe circulation disease (circulatory insufficiency)\"\n\u2022 \"heart attack\" is usually caused by blockage in, or a clot blocking the blood supply from your heart.\n\nSome cardiovascular symptoms include:\n\n\u2022 \"dyspnea\" - \"dyspnea\" is the sensation that your breathing is shallow or difficult.\n\u2022 \"fluid retention\" - \"fluid retention\" is swelling of the arms and legs that makes it difficult to move around.\n\u2022 Fatigue - \" fatigue\" is a tired feeling (aching, aching pain, aching pain)\n\u2022 \"cold hands and feet\" and \"burning\" sensations in the hands and feet\n\u2022 \"fainting\" - \"fainting\", \"sudden loss of consciousness\"\n\u2022 \"high blood pressure\" (see above)\n\u2022 \"swelling\", \"a condition in which blood vessels swell and become stiff and enlarged, usually by increasing your blood volume due to diabetes.

They use the 'Best practice NHS guideline' found on the NHS website and take into account all of the available evidence including the results of an expert team. \n4. What is the BMI (Body Mass Index): BMI is a calculation of individuals heights and weights based on height and weight measurements\nIt works as a ratio for healthy people. It has been shown to be related to several health markers, including CVD, diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers. \n4.1. BMI Formula and Calculations\nBMI is calculated using height and weight equations, and it considers height and weight to work as a simple proportion to weight. \n4.2. BMI Calculator\nTo calculate BMI, just follow these steps:\n  1. Read the BMI calculator online: http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/healthy-people/calculating-your-body-mass-in-10-seconds/index.shtml   \n2. Find the height based your height and weight measurements and compare them. If they are both similar, you should multiply their size by two to get BMI.\n3. Enter your height and weight. \nIf they are both similar, you should divide they by 2 to get BMI.\n4. If BMI is found to be healthy for that person for certain measures, update the BMI to healthier conditions, then update it to healthy body mass.\n5. Update your BMI to healthier health conditions if it looks like the BMI chart you did before. \n4.3. BMI 7.7 mmol/L for 17-21 year old:\nIn light of your age and height information, use the BMI calculator to calculate your height based on your age. You would be looking at your age minus your height, divided by that height, to get your BMI.\nBMI is the inverse of the height to weight ratio. Therefore 7.7 mmol/L = 0.7 / 17 = 7.7/1.0 = 7.7\n6. BMI calculator for healthy weight for 23-30 year old  [BMI Calculator](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/healthy-people/calculate-your-body-mass-in-10-seconds/index.html)\n7. BMI 5-65 year old (BMI >65):\n   This BMI calculator makes adjustments based on weight, age, family history of CVD, ethnicity, and overall health. It also takes into account the gender. The BMI for an adult with a BMI of 5-65 years old in the UK is 25.5. For information about the healthy blood pressure in this age range, see this link:\nHere's how your BMI calculator will work for these individuals.\n- 25.5 - BMI 25.5 is in fact a reference BMI, which is the number that the NHS uses as an everyday scale measure (e.g. in the UK 25-29 year old people are still underweight without having high blood pressure). By having this BMI below 25.5, you are likely to be healthy in most instances, but you would not be clinically safe as a patient. 7.7 mmol/L is a BMI of 7.7 but still within normal values, but 0.7 is considered overweight or obese. If you are severely overweight or obese you risk health risks by having higher LDL cholesterol levels, which can trigger heart disease. If your BMI is above 40, you are most likely to be considered overweight or obese and can develop health risks such as a high blood pressure. 8.

Approximately 80% of adult populations is at increased risk of developing CVD in the next 15 years.\n\nHeart Disease is the leading killer of both men and women. There is currently no effective treatment for the main causes of heart disease. Most sufferers are not aware of the risk factors which can develop into heart disease. We have identified that poor diet is amongst the most harmful to our health.\n\nThe risk factors for developing heart disease include poor intake of saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium which are known to increase arterial disease. There are additional risk factors linked to poor diet such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, obesity & being overweight/obese, and smoking.\n\nDiabetes is the most prominent risk factor in the UK today. The World Health Organization and the American Diabetes Association suggest a 14% reduction in the incidence of diabetes between 1980 and 2004.\nThe risk of developing diabetes in the UK is predicted to increase further in the coming years. The number of people already diagnosed with diabetes is expected to more than double by 2030.\n\nThe risk factors to the prevention of diabetes in the UK are as follows:-\n\n\u2022 Being overweight.\n\u2022 Being overweight/obese.\n\u2022 Smoking.\n\u2022 Having gestational diabetes and having type 1 diabetes (if you have them).\n\u2022 Being diabetic, diabetic prediabetic or pre-diabetic\n\n## 1850-present \u2013 CHD and CVD\n\nIt is very important that we can get more people in the UK into the health care system in order to improve the health of the population overall and as many people would like to and need to be included in it and there are other factors that impact on it, but we need to look at all possible risk factors in order to make a long lasting change.\nThere are many causes of CHD and CVD to consider, including:\nType 2 Diabetes\nHigh Blood Pressure\nHigh Blood Fats\nUnhealthy Eating Habits\nLack of Physical Activity\nObesity/Overweight/Obese\nGenetic and Environmental Factors\n\n## 1850 to Present \u2013 Hypertension\n\nHypertension is generally defined as a body mass index of over 18 kg (40 pounds), or if a BMI greater than 30. It is likely that we have met some of these risk factors already and we are all affected by them and we will be affected by it all year round.\n\nOne-in-eight adults in the UK have hypertension, 5% of all cases of heart disease. With increasing numbers of people becoming fat people in society (i.e. obese), this is a growing threat to our health.

As mentioned previously you are a young, black, male, female, and a comorbido-obesity-cardiometabolic comorbid(d)/interactive comorbidity(d) has been identified.\n2. There are few, if any, comorbid heart disease (CAD) or diabetes factors and you currently smoke.\n3.

Your comorbid cardiac disease is well documented, and your diagnosis has to be ruled by primary care providers.\n\nYou propose an intervention with these 4 recommendations. Please review this document as well as your previous comments and I will do my best to support you.\n\nThank you!\n\nThe cardiovascular issue is likely to be a primary issue which must be addressed to help the patients manage their underlying CVDs, especially when it comes to tobacco use. For the individual contributing to the CVD they will need to quit, so you may already have information to guide them, for example if they have been diagnosed with coronary disease or stroke, they have been prescribed aspirin, or are in a stable relationship with someone who has cardiovascular disease or who is using any type of medication that is known to be related to CVD. This person is likely to need further specialist education in the areas of cardiovascular disease and medication management and the type of recommendations in that would be tailored to that individual and their other CVDs.\n\nYou are currently in a relationship with someone you are not 100% good with on a regular basis and that is likely to result in you smoking. There is no recommendation for individuals in this relationship to stop smoking completely before treating their CVDs, but smoking will significantly increase your risk for coronary artery disease and cardiovascular disease in general. You will need to address these risks as part of your management.\n\nThe other condition for which there is no objective data available is diabetes. Again this individual has suffered a history of diabetes that can impact on their future outcome, and this should be addressed by using a non-expensive and simple programme such as Tight Diabetics and the above recommendations. As much of this person's personal history may be at the individual care level or they have not been able to control their diabetes, these people may need extra specialist care.\n\nThe other CVDs that you mention are likely to be a primary problem in this individual and would be treated by you. Your recommendations include a variety of lifestyle changes as well as medications and interventions for diabetes and other CVDs where appropriate. However you need to consider a patient who is smoking and/or alcohol consuming. There is some evidence to suggest that individuals with a history of smoking are at increased risk for heart disease and for some types of CVDs. Given the context of the patient's primary care experience, it could be reasonable to try to address the smoking issue and reduce their risk for CVD. Based on the existing research, how smoking might impact on a patient's outcomes is likely to be relevant and if you could identify a guideline for smoking control, your suggestions could be of great importance.\n\nPlease mention if the patient has a history of mental health issues, or any illness that could be related to these as it is likely to be a primary health issue, and your recommendations would be appropriate. Please note that your recommendations could also be targeted at someone with secondary illness such as any health care professional who may not be experienced with your person's individual needs and, as a general guideline, if a person is feeling depressed, anxious, suicidal, agitated or have physical symptoms that could be related to physical illness, this is a referral for another professional.

Based on these characteristics alone and ignoring everything else, such as the name, provide recommendations on CVD guidelines based on NICE for this person (this case was not given the name). You will need to identify the problem correctly and evaluate your patient in detail.\n\n### Discussion and Reflection\n\nThis example illustrates the importance of thoroughly examining the patient's complete medical history. By considering such details, you can begin to formulate a personalized CVD guideline that considers the patient's unique background, lifestyle, and co-morbidities. In this case, a well-informed patient would have recommended lifestyle modifications leading to improvement in their heart health.\n\nPractice Activity:\n\n1. Research your own personal health history and identify any potential CVDs such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, family history of heart disease, and tobacco use.\n2. Follow the guidance provided by NICE for recommending lifestyle changes. Based on this guidance, create a customized CVD guideline for your patient using the \"CVDs\" section.\n\nBy understanding the intricacies of CVD and implementing evidence-based guidelines based on patients' individual characteristics, healthcare professionals can improve heart health outcomes and promote longevity.", "John has these features: Age: 41, BMI: 34.5, Blood Pressure: 125/94 mmHg, \n    Total Cholesterol: 7.7 mmol/L, HDL Cholesterol: 0.7 mmol/L, \n    Smoking Status: current smoker, Diabetes: Type 2 diabetes, \n    Family History of CVD: no, Ethnicity: Black Caribbean. Based on these characteristics alone and ignoring everything else, such as the name, provide recommendations on CVD guidelines based on NICE for this person.\n\nTo derive a CVD guideline that is suitable for your patient, let us define the CVD for the individual as follows:\n\n\"CVD is defined as: a) a risk factor in one or more of the following: 1) hypertension, 2) diabetes, 3) A2G7 mutations of the APOCs 4) Hyperglycemia in the presence of hypertension 5) Dyslipidemia, high blood pressure, protein diabetes-1, protein diabetes-2, blood lipids, and polycystic ovary syndrome... 6) Smoking, 3 years history 85/94 mmHg and >140 mmHg on the 95th percentile, the level at which there is a 5% risk of death from any cause.\"\n\nBased on this, we need a CVD guideline that, since hypertension or diabetes is the root cause of CVD, will improve patient outcomes.\n\nThe primary function of the CVD guideline recommendation is to have an explanation of how it calculates a CVD based on the above guidelines. To do this, a CVD guideline recommendation must describe the purpose and rationale of the proposed CVD guidelines. The rationale consists of the relevant, scientifically proven facts, which the CVD guidelines do not have.\n\nFor our CVD guideline, it states three main purposes to help patients understand and manage the CVD they already have:\n\n1. To prevent and treat CVD.\n2. To reduce the incidence of CVD, especially heart attacks.\n3. To decrease the prevalence of CVD in the general population, especially in non-white populations.\n\nThe CVD guideline recommendation describes if the CVD guideline recommends following a specific path to better outcomes. This path could be either 1. Following a specific path to reduced mortality, 2. Following a specific path to reduced mortality, or 3. Following a specific path to reduced death. 4. Following a specific path to reduced and/or increased mortality. 5. Going forward with a certain path to improve mortality. 6. Going forward with a specific path that, once the initial path to improve mortality is established, is a good path to improve the overall risk for CVD. 7. Going forward with the first path to improve mortality. Also considered is the pathway to lower risk of CVD among other populations. 8. Going forward with further progression of the path to lower risk. 9. Going forward with a specific pathway to decrease the risk of CVD among at least 40% of people who have experienced CHD treatment at or before their initial diagnosis. 10. Going forward with a specific path to reduce the risk of CVD among at least 80% of people who have experienced previous CHD treatment. 11. The path to reduce the risk of CVD.\n\nGiven the criteria that would be needed to qualify as a CVD guideline recommendation, the process would follow the steps below:\n\n1. The CVD guideline recommendation would be written in a simplified form, while considering some of the above purposes.\n\n2. Any doctor or primary care provider involved in the cardiovascular (CV) care delivery might find the CVD guideline recommendation helpful, particularly in cases where they are unaware of the CVD guidelines.\n\n3. Once a CVD guideline recommendation has been provided, the CVD guideline recommendation should be reviewed by the healthcare team, who needs to make final arrangements to implement the CVD guidelines.\n\nOnce the CVD guideline recommendation has been presented to the healthcare team, further consultations and discussions should occur with the healthcare team to adjust and review the CVD guideline recommendations.\n\n## Healthcare Team Collaboration\n\nHealthcare team collaboratively work in a collaborative effort to implement the outlined CVD guideline recommendations. Collaborations with other healthcare providers, patients, lay people, and other patients' family members are important to consider and discuss during the process.\n\nThe Healthcare team can also consider other aspects of healthcare delivery that are relevant to the person they care for, like a treatment, education or support group.\n\n## Assessment\n\nThe assessment process will include:\n\n1. Physical examination.\n\n2. Cardiology Screening and Analysis.\n\n3. Cardiology, Cardiovascular, and Vascular Disease Assessment.\n\n4. Cardiology and Vascular Disease Management.\n\n### Physical Examination\n\nThe physical exam would be performed by the doctor and the patient. The doctor will perform an exam to review patient's current health, the patient's family history, medical history, symptoms, and lifestyle.

However, 41% of individuals with BMI 32 or higher do not have a normal glycaemia.\n* The NICE recommendation for these individuals in the above findings is to have this condition treated if it has not been diagnosed or if the symptoms do not improve.\n\nQuestion 2: Explain the following statement with reference to relevant medical evidence about the role of vitamin C in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe effect of vitamin C for the treatment of type 2 diabetes is still an area of interest in the scientific community. In 2005, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved NAC (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) as a potential treatment for type 2 diabetes in 2007.  \nIn 2012 the Food Standards Commission reported that 58% of the US population had one or more serious diabetes-related health complications, including kidney disease, eye disease, and peripheral neuropathy.  \nIn 2006, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, vitamin C is responsible for the normal function of red blood cells.  \nIn 2014, the US National Library of Medicine recommended that supplementation with vitamin C be done once in a year, either in the preadolescent or adolescent years, when blood-glucose levels are usually low with diabetes, and at times of illness or infection, when vitamin C can help reverse diabetes by assisting the immune system.  \nIn a recent Cochrane study, 40 participants with diabetes, aged 19-64, were given 200mg of ascorbic acid every day (1g per day) for five consecutive days. They were then allowed to take the placebo or their normal diet for another five days and were reevaluated the next day. They had a significant reduction in glycaemia levels with the ascorbic acid and there was a strong recommendation that treatment be continued for five days.  \nHowever, many people, especially those with severe diabetes and poor compliance, will experience an overall decrease in blood glucose concentrations, and that the most effective approach to treating such patients is often to switch them to a simple and easy to follow glucose control programme.  \nIn practice there are three primary steps in this plan: \n- An adjustment of the medication to a greater level of insulin if required. \n- Reducing/eliminating excess carbohydrates. \n- Modifying the diet according to requirements. *\n\nQuestion 3: Define what you mean by the term primary clinical research and provide some examples of research you have seen.\n\nPrimary clinical research is conducted to understand the effects of a particular therapy on a subgroup of patients. For example, in the context of diabetes, a pilot study might be performed to determine whether two therapies are better than one. **The following type of research is a pilot study if it tests a new treatment. **\n\nExample:\nPrimary clinical research: In this study, if the effects of two diabetes drug treatments \u2013 a type of new blood glucose testing device, metformin (fructosamine testing on fasting blood or blood before and after glucose lowering, and a diabetes monitoring system) and a new blood glucose control plan \u2013 the study is a type of new experimental clinical research and can be called a \u201cqualitative [non-quantitative] study\" rather than a \"type\" clinical trial.\n\nOther examples of primary research include:\n\u2022 An exploratory clinical trial.\n\u2022 Clinical trials designed to define the cause of a disease, or new interventions aimed at preventing new diseases. \n\u2022 Trials involving either patients or patients themselves, rather than between patients.\n", "John has these features: Age: 41, BMI: 34.5, Blood Pressure: 125/94 mmHg, \n    Total Cholesterol: 7.7 mmol/L, HDL Cholesterol: 0.7 mmol/L, \n    Smoking Status: current smoker, Diabetes: Type 2 diabetes, \n    Family History of CVD: no, Ethnicity: Black Caribbean.

His blood pressure is 114/61 mmHg, and his total cholesterol is 6.7 mmol/L with an HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L. He is a current smoker, does not have diabetes, but has a family history of CVD. He has never had heart-healthy diet or lifestyle modifications, and is also physically active. The 16 best coronary heart disease (CHD) guideline from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, based on evidence received in 2017 by NICE and published by the British Cardiac Journal, found that John's risk score and the corresponding CHD risk score are:\n20.6 (73.8) mmHg\n6 (3.7) mmHg\nHbA1c \u22656.0% < 8\n18.1% of people with existing CVD may benefit from CVD prevention.\n27.3 (6.9) mmHg\n2 (1.7) mmHg\nG70/9 (42/48) < 11.6\n11.1% of people with existing CVD may benefit from CVD prevention.\nIn this case, John is eligible to receive recommendations to prevent future CVD to reduce the chances of developing it, and all recommendations are included in the guideline. For example:\nThe top 10 recommendations for John with established CVD disease include 35% lower cholesterol, 24% lower triglycerides, and 15% lower alcohol intake. He is advised to quit smoking, and his family history of CVD is known as a strong CHD risk profile. His blood pressure increases, and he is currently in danger of developing the related blood vessel disease, a form of CHD known as atherosclerosis.\nJohn has not yet had a lipid profile or cholesterol level-lowering medication taken in the previous month. It is possible that he is due for surgery to treat hypertension when he is in his middle age.\nAll recommendations are included in this guideline.\nHow does the above guideline align with previous evidence?. Review from BMJ Quality Standards published in 2017 by the National Centre for Health Statistics, UK, found that the guideline offers the following recommendations from evidence in relation to the general public:\nIt is an individual healthcare decision that may influence a person\u2019s risk of developing CHD (cardiovascular disease; CV disease).\nA healthy and balanced diet and lifestyle can help reduce an individual\u2019s risk for developing CHD and reduce their overall health risk.\nLifestyle modifications (exercise more regularly, manage diabetes or hypertension, diet and weight loss, smoking cessation) and genetic and environmental risk factors known to be associated with increased risk of CVD are also well-established as lifestyle modifications.\nThis guideline was developed and reviewed by a large group of healthcare professionals and experts in the field of CHD. At one time, only patients with established CHD were consulted. The guideline focuses on the overall health status of a patient, but not on individuals who suffer from a single CHD, who may not also benefit from their management.\nThe above guideline was developed to be used in the community setting, where patients receive a general advice to lower their risk for future developing CVD. However, there is also some room for adjustment in the guideline, for example:\nEvidence-based guideline does not reflect the opinion of the experts\nThe current literature shows that the recommendations made by the guideline is not based on the findings of expert opinion or research studies and is not based on the opinion of doctors who are already in practice. The recommendation is not based on medical practice.\nThe guideline is not based on established evidence from medical research or clinical evidence so that it cannot be used to predict the results that will be obtained.\nIn the UK and Australia, the British Cardiac Journal is part of the Australian Society for Clinical Sciences. The guidelines are based on data available in the British Society for Cardiology Consensus Clinical Practice Standards (BDCCCS) document and the World Health Organization Standards for Cardiology, which are currently used in Australia.\nHow can this guideline inform other people in their work or personal life?\nThis guideline is being used in the healthcare sector by healthcare professionals who work in clinical practice.

His blood pressure is 114/61 mmHg, and his total cholesterol is 6.7 mmol/L with an HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L. He is a current smoker, does not have diabetes, but has a family history of CVD. His wife was diagnosed with diabetes and she did not make dietary and exercise recommendations for this young man. The physician prescribed several medications for hypertension, CVD, or both, including blood pressure medication, aspirin, and statins. The physician prescribed four antihypotensive medications over the course of several weeks. The physician also prescribed a diet, including a calorie deficit of 6000kcal to facilitate cardiac changes (Hornak and Nair 2018).\nThe clinical data is presented in Table 1 and the literature is given in Table 2. The patient, John, is 70 years old, with a BMI of 30. His previous BP, cholesterol (HDL-C: 1.85), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), haemoglobin A1C: 5.4% with an SF-96 scale (11-point score score >35% is considered healthy), and total cholesterol of 97.3 mg/dL (4.1), with A1C of 4.3% (with a fasting blood glucose of 120 mg/dL) is considered healthy (NICE 2011). His blood pressure is 114/61 mmHg (n = 14). He is a smoker (200 cigarettes per day), since his wife is a smoker. His blood pressure is within the guidelines for those with a normal range, but high when compared to the normative data (Hornak and Nair 2018).\nThis patient\u2019s primary treatment options are lifestyle changes and medicines. While the patient was told to restrict alcohol, quit smoking at least once, and exercise in the winter, she did not follow this advice and was a smoker for 12 years before she was diagnosed with CVD (NICE 2011). Her blood pressure was monitored every week, which was found to be in range to the NHANES definition (NHS 2007). She is at increased risk of CVD because she has been diagnosed with depression for the past five years, and her treatment was less than prescribed; her blood pressure medication is not prescribed (NICE 2011). Her treatment is changing. Her primary treatment is smoking cessation but only when she met with her specialist to be prescribed medication to be taken for 2 months. His primary medication is a statin in combination with a calcium channel blocker. Her diet has changed, since he was told to stop smoking and to consume 2 servings of vegetables and 1 serving of fruits on a daily basis. He has a lot of physical activity, which he did by jogging in the morning after breakfast, and by having a high-protein weight, and by walking to school. At the end of the study, his cholesterol is in range (NICE 2011).\nThe next option is to avoid smoking, but he says that he could still use it when he knows that it is becoming difficult. Her primary health care provider has suggested that she consult with her family and friends before making any major decision. The next option is to restrict alcohol. Although he has been drinking heavily for the last 10 years, it is impossible for him to change his drinking habits after he started smoking; he is concerned that his weight will worsen in the future due to his drinking (NICE 2011).\nThe physician has recommended screening blood pressure and lipid levels as a first, secondary, and third line of treatment. He says that if the patient\u2019s blood pressure and cholesterol measures are within the limits, one next option he recommends is to take a statin to prevent cardiovascular disease (Hornak and Nair 2019). He suggests, although he still does have concerns about diet and treatment, he is willing to accept that diet and lifestyle are in his best interest. His husband\u2019s doctor and nurse, together with his lifestyle advisor, advised him to have an ultrasound to check his CABG (Cochlear Abbess). He was able to choose which medication to take; he takes a statin, he starts exercising, he stops smoking, and after his son has become healthy, he starts taking a calcium channel blocker to stabilize blood pressure without taking statins (Hornak and Nair 2019).\nTable 3 summarizes the drug therapy recommendations.

The diagnosis of coronary heart disease is currently considered in the following circumstances: a. The man has had symptoms of coronary heart disease more than 4 months in 2 to 3 years (i.e., 5 or more at a three-month interval) and has a current history of aspirin consumption (more than 700 mg/day) with a duration of 6 months or more, at least one annual return visit to the doctor's office, or, if the patient does not have symptoms of myocardial infarction, has a family history of myocardial infarction; 2. The man's heart-rate (systolic = M/s) is 130/90 mmHg or over for over 1 year and has not been diagnosed since the time of diagnosis; 3. The man's total cholesterol, LDL, or HDL cholesterol level is greater than 200 mmol/L; or the man's blood pressure, systolic, \u2265 140 mmHg for > 1 year and has not been diagnosed since diagnosis. There is no known primary smoking history that may impact heart disease. The man has also suffered from diabetes for 20 years since he had a diagnosis of diabetes, who also has heart disease, unless a family history of diabetes is determined based on the assessment, or he has chronic hypertension since there is no family history of hypertension. The patient is a normal weight male, without any of these symptoms, no smoking history has occurred for the previous 26 years, and does not have a history of cardiovascular disease other than coronary heart disease. The diagnosis of coronary heart disease for the patient is consistent with a normal history of coronary heart disease and is based on the criteria from NICE-CLN 3. The clinical examination includes a careful review of the patient's risk factors and cardiac examination with an exercise stress test. The patient's total and HDL cholesterol (i.e. total, HDL, \u2265 70 mg/dL; LDL, < 70 mg/dL; or 2.0 mmol/L) are monitored during follow-up for a total cholesterol level of \u2265 8.6 mmol/L and a HDL cholesterol level \u2265 1.8 mmol/L. The patients' cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, family history of CVD, and risk factor score for myocardial infarction, and for risk factors for stroke, are reviewed, as well. In addition, chest pain or discomfort with exertion as well as shortness of breath with exertion are evaluated as they occur. A complete blood count (CBC) with normal RBC counts (\u2265 99,99% white cell count) is obtained, with normal peripheral blood smear (pancytopenia) and normal or normal white blood cell count. The patient's medical weight status is assessed using a standardized 20-kg body mass index. Physical examinations, ECG, and other cardiac tests are performed according to established guidelines where applicable in the NICE guidelines. The doctor performs a digital subtraction exercise (DSE) to assess the patient's cardiovascular fitness. The doctor examines the patient with the help of a portable chest strap and a handheld chest strap. The person wears the chest strap during normal physical exercise to assess aerobic capacity. The doctor also evaluates the person after he/she has completed his/her exercise program, while he/she is standing, sitting or lying down, and asks for the time required for the exercise to complete. In addition, the examiner assesses the patient's heart rate and rhythm with a continuous electrocardiograph (CECG). The exercise is performed in one-lap time steps, with an interval of 40 seconds. The total exercise time is calculated for the individual and the entire group. After the assessment, the doctor is given a report of the exercise to be finished, a summary report of the entire test, and a report of the ECG and CECG with no measurement performed to make the report complete. The patient is placed under general anaesthesia at surgery. The doctor removes the patient from the gas cylinder and takes the patient to a private examination room. On the outside of the room, the doctor opens the man's left rib cage and hands the chest strap of the person to him. He then makes the left rib cage part of the chest strap. This is necessary to adjust the measurements of the rib cage for the test. Before the chest strap is taken off, the patient is asked to stand and look at the doctor.", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30. His blood pressure is 114/61 mmHg, and his total cholesterol is 6.7 mmol/L with an HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L. He is a current smoker, does not have diabetes, but has a family history of CVD. He is at risk for coronary artery heart disease because of his risk factors for CVD. He experiences dizziness or lightheadedness when he takes a medication, which affects his ability to maintain self-care. The first course of treatment to prevent CVD is to quit smoking.\nA multidisciplinary team\nNICE guidelines recommend that John and his general practitioner (GP) consider:\n(i) lifestyle changes that include:\n(a) weight reduction (diets)\n(b) physical activity\n(c) control of blood pressure and cholesterol\n(ii) prescription drugs including medications for hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol, smoking cessation, calcium-channel blockers, statin drugs.\nPreliminary evidence suggests that lifestyle changes are better than any other intervention, even when weight reduction alone is achieved. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, issued guidelines on lifestyle interventions with these conditions in 2008, published in 32 publications. Other reviews of their recommendations, published in the peer-reviewed journals Hypertension (the Journal of the American College of Cardiology) and Hypertension, Heart Failure (Heart Failure), and Atherosclerosis, recommended lifestyle modifications for high blood pressure (HBP), which includes diet, physical activity, and smoking cessation (the guidelines by the American Heart Association). This has led to the widespread use of high-quality programs for increasing HDL levels by the American Dietetic Association. A recent literature review shows that lifestyle interventions are associated with reductions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as reductions in the risk of cardiovascular events, mortality, and all-cause mortality (the 2006 Heart Failure study). The authors suggest that heart failure patients may benefit from lifestyle intervention programs such as the Cochrane Review on the Lifestyle Interventions in Patients With Heart Failure.\nNon-pharmacological interventions for hypertension, heart failure, and CVD\nFor patients who are either non-cardiometabolic patients and who desire lifestyle modifications, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines recommend diet and lifestyle modifications alone, in addition to medications for hypertension, heart failure, lipid disorders, diabetes, and smoking cessation. The guidelines are based on evidence from multiple interventions, with the goal of achieving long-term health goals of preventing cardiovascular disease and maintaining health into old age.\nThere is no clear evidence of efficacy of nutrition or exercise interventions compared with no intervention. The literature includes only case-control studies reporting on the effects of diet changes on symptoms of depression and on mortality. There are currently no randomised trials assessing the role of nutrition or exercise for the prevention of CVD and this remains uncertain.\nA systematic review by the Nutrition Society of the United Kingdom published in 2009 summarised 24 studies. The 24 included studies analysed 30 observational studies, 92 case\u2013control studies and cross-sectional observational studies. There is no evidence of effectiveness. Most published studies with diets and exercise interventions have been in older patients, however some small studies have been carried out with younger patients. The risk of publication bias is also not as great for these older patients because of the small size of the numbers involved \u2013 20-30 cases per study without treatment and 1,000-3,000 cases per study without treatment.\nThe Cochrane review on nutrition and exercise for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in non-diabetics 16 years or older that included 10 studies showed that there was no difference in mortality with exercise, no difference in coronary heart disease in the absence of exercise, and no difference in metabolic syndrome development with exercise. The authors recommend clinicians to educate themselves to be aware of exercise and nutritional recommendations and refer patients to specialists before the initiation of any exercise regimen.\nPhysical activity and nutrition\nPhysical activity and physical inactivity, particularly among older adults, are increasing in prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and poor physical health. Regular physical activity has clear health benefits.\nThe American Heart Association recommends adults aged 18\u201364 years aged should engage in at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or incorporate resistance training such as weightlifting or body weight exercises. The guidelines state that adults aged 65 or older should engage in strength exercises, such as wall sits, push-ups, and weightlifting. Physical activity is important, as a sedentary lifestyle increases the risk of CVD and its complications. Physical activity has been shown to be protective", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30. His blood pressure is 114/61 mmHg, and his total cholesterol is 6.7 mmol/L with an HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L. He is a current smoker, does not have diabetes, but has a family history of CVD. He eats an unusual eating plan: a vegetable high in potassium. At the start of his program, NICE recommended for KI intake should not exceed 122.7 g/day. The program was started and continued for 12 weeks. The goal was to control his CVD risk to below 30% (based on risk factors and lifestyle). After 12 weeks of KI, KI levels were above 27.6 mg/dL. KI was also sufficient to control high lipid levels, but the cholesterol in KI had not improved. The risk of new-onset coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) was greater than that of patients without CHD, and increased to 21 years in those without CHD. This is a 10% reduction vs. the 8% reported in NHANES 1999-2004. KI should be an important part of a cardiologic treatment plan if patients with hypertension, diabetes, and poor lifestyle are at very high risk of a future CVD. The new guidelines highlight that KI cannot be substituted for any other CVD agent (although it is suggested to be discontinued in certain patients with CHD, known as low-risk). However, KI is not contraindicated in all cases. No evidence has been found suggesting that high-dose KI will induce blood clots or increase the likelihood of blood clotting, so current guidelines recommend high-dose KI (1 ml/kg/dose, 80 mg/day) in conjunction with exercise to maintain good blood lipids in patients with CHD. No evidence of a benefit and no justification for KI use in patients with hypertension, diabetes, or poor lifestyle, for which there is evidence to support the use of KI in combination with high-dose aspirin (400 mg/day) or TNF therapy. KI should be used only after high risk and chronic illness, as the benefit is considered negligible in patients with current CHD or prior CHD. KI should not be used after high-risk or current CHD, but is advised for patients who have a history of high-level CVD prior to initial treatment. KI is to be used in non-HDCT patients only as a supplement to existing treatment. KI is not intended to be an overnight cure of CVD. The use of KI is reserved for patients with high-level CVD, in whom treatment with conventional treatment and/or pharmacological therapy has failed. KI should only be used for patients with recent cardiovascular disease and/or treatment with pharmacological therapy. Current guidelines suggest that the potential benefits outweigh the potential harm. Given the substantial improvement in vascular disease in individuals with well-managed KI, future guidelines recommend continued administration in patients with CVD who have experienced moderate deterioration of clinical outcomes. KI increases blood cholesterol levels. The recommended daily dose of KI is 40 mg/day, and KI is currently not recommended for patients with no evidence of a cardiovascular event (ie, a patient with no previous history of vascular disease, no evidence of a recent cardiac event or CVD recurrence, no cardiovascular risk factors, or no current clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease). KI should be discontinued in patients with a documented CVD. KI increases plasma lipoproteins. KI alone is not contraindicated in certain patients. KI or aspirin will cause increased blood glucose levels; therefore, KI is not indicated in patients with type 2 diabetes. KI should be used as instructed. In a 14-year-old patient with diabetes, the median number of days to end medication resistance/event was 2.8 days 7, and the median duration of treatment was 12.8 weeks 6. Sorted them together. The median duration of treatment, 12.8 weeks (range = 1.5 - 18.9 years), was significantly higher than the median duration of 5. Sorted them together. Sorted them together. Although the median number of days to end medication resistance/event was 1.5 days 7, the median duration of treatment was 21.2 weeks (range = 7 - 31.7 years) and the median duration of treatment was 72.5 weeks (range = 41.5 - 199.4 years).

The patient is told that a \u201chealthy-life\u201d standard is to eat around 2000 calories a day while limiting sodium intake, and to avoid cholesterol and blood pressure-provoking foods at all costs. The patient is instructed to decrease their intake of alcohol and carbohydrates, which will also lower their LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol. The patient\u2019s cholesterol level is kept at 95 mg/dL, and is encouraged to monitor his blood pressures, and to limit his intake of alcohol and carbohydrate if necessary. The following procedures are necessary prior to the appointment but after one week: a) Blood to monitor: 1 x 50 mg of aspirin a day through the medication \u201cclopidogrel\u201d or \u201cclopidogrel for angina\u201d and 2 x 50 mg of aspirin a day if he developed symptoms during the period of observation (7 days), with a subsequent dose of clopidogrel and/or aspirin, every 4 weeks (3 days). b) Blood to monitor: 1 x blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg (normal is: less than 130/85 mmHg), and to keep his blood glucose (A1C) as near to 7% as possible while he decreases his intake of foods that promote the absorption of glucose: nuts, fruits (saturated fat free), whole cereals, fish, meats, vegetables (organic, fresh), lean proteins (non-processed), dairy (low in fat), eggs (3.5g/day), and bread (bread 1.15g/day). c) Monitoring of weight: an adult BMI calculator is available.\nThe information provided is taken to ensure correct medication usage.

His blood pressure is 114/61 mmHg, and his total cholesterol is 6.7 mmol/L with an HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L. He is a current smoker, does not have diabetes, but has a family history of CVD. He is a healthy patient with a normal resting heart rate (90 s) and an acceptable glucose tolerance (9 mmol/L) and normal lipid profile (total cholesterol 125 mmol/L, LDL cholesterol 100 mmol/L, and LDL-C 30,000 ug/dL). He is a patient with a medical record that specifies that a 2-dose 60-mg daily dose of quercetin hydrochloride is prescribed for his treatment. His family physician wants to know the patient's baseline cholesterol level and whether he has an existing coronary artery disease. His medical chart contains a recent medical history with a history of 1,000 mg of aspirin and other drugs prior to taking quercetin hydrochloride. His physician determines that he has one of two major causes for his cholesterol levels. His first is that he has had an episode of angina in the past 6 months prior to taking the quercetin, and he is on medications for angina. His second is that he has recently developed hypertension that appears to be related to the use of quercetin. His family physician also determines that there is a history of obesity and sedentary lifestyle, and that he regularly consumes 2-3 glasses of sugar-sweetened beverages a day. His family doctor gives him a complete history of recent high cholesterol measurements (total cholesterol 150 mmol/L, LDL cholesterol 100 mmol/L, LDL-C 250 mg/dL or lower) and the history of two new cardiovascular episodes that occurred within 4 weeks prior to taking quercetin. The next item in the medication history is that he has taken six different medications within the past 12 months, including diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins, digoxin, and thiazide diuretics. He is not taking aspirin due to his history of aspirin toxicity, but is currently on three other classes of drugs to test for a possible interaction or contraindication with quercetin. His family physician is unsure if his family history indicates an association between quercetin and elevated blood sugar. When asked about his past diet, he said \"regularly ate fresh fruit, vegetables, and fish, and did not add salt to his diet. He also made no more diet modifications than was necessary to meet daily caloric and nutritional requirements.\" His family doctor also asked for his age, BMI, gender, educational level, smoking history, and his family history of diabetes. He was found wanting that he had recently started taking quercetin for his cholesterol and had become interested in a 60-mg dose, but not enough time to do so. He is therefore advised to stop taking quercetin for the first 12 months. Following this, he continues taking the quercetin for approximately 12 months before stopping the medications. His family physician has recommended that he discuss this with his physician. He is advised to discontinue his quercetin for 6 months, and then restart the medication at 6 months' intervals until a diagnosis of diabetes is made. After completing his 6 months of quercetin medication, he has his cholesterol measured again, and remains at 100 / 61 mg/L as shown before starting quercetin. He responds well to quercetin, and he is no longer interested in having his cholesterol measured. His family physician notes that he has been having occasional palpitations and palpitations for three minutes each hour for the past week. An electrocardiogram (EKG) shows no symptoms during these times. When it is indicated that he should begin quercetin treatment, he signs an \"Admit, Give Up, or Stop' card for this and several other medications, and he is instructed to give up his medications, including quercetin, for the first 12 months. His family doctor suggests that he should also discuss these treatments with his primary care physician, although he is not recommended to tell their physicians of them. The rest of the medications he takes are listed in the Medication Record. His family physician mentions taking 60 mg daily for six days; however, he is told that he is 27 years old. The primary care doctor also tells him that he is not eligible for the new medication. He is told to visit his doctor for a blood test, but does not want to proceed with the medication because he is concerned.

He has normal blood glucose levels. He has normal fasting and three-hour glucose tolerance tests at random. There are no other significant risk factors for CVD. He has been a regular user of AEDs. In contrast, John has an at-risk family history of hypertension and diabetes, as well as a history of a recent heart attack, which may put him at risk for future heart disease and related non-cardiovascular problems. Both John and his wife will need to undergo treatment for cardiac bypass surgery using a stent. John's initial management consists of using 25 mmHg of BP lowering medication, and then gradually tapering him off the beta blockers with a long-acting beta agonist (LABA, Lisetan) based on the individual response and his overall condition and medical concerns. The regimen is followed up every 3 months for four weeks. John is beginning to feel better and he can now function and return to his usual activities. We are following this regimen for two months for an evaluation of any potential adverse cardiac events.\nDuring this 1-month analysis to determine the effectiveness and stability of the management under this treatment regimen, we will compare the following outcome measures:\n1. Blood pressure\nTo compare, determine the differences between those patient groups who received the standard practice and those who were administered the treatment regimen consisting of 25 mmHg of BP lowering medication.\n2. End-of-life survival\nThis is the survival of the patient. There are several things that must be in place to achieve the ideal outcome for this patient and the standard treatment regimen. These include:\na) Early initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy, which may be life-long use, at the age of 65yrs or older, as recommended by NICE and approved through the UK National Health Service, as listed above.\nb) A gradual tapering regimen as described previously in the literature, which should be at moderate to gradual pace of 1 year.\nc) Regular follow-up visits at the appropriate intervals, as recommended by NICE to assess progress.\n3.

His blood pressure is 114/61 mmHg, and his total cholesterol is 6.7 mmol/L with an HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L. He is a current smoker, does not have diabetes, but has a family history of CVD. He has previously been treated with antihypertensive medication and has experienced a sudden, severe angina attack after a myocardial infarction. The NICE guidelines have been published and recommended by NICE, but there have been no systematic evidence reviews of the guidelines (Barton et al., 2019).\nThe majority of the world\u2019s CVDs burden is preventable through improving diet, diet and exercise, and reducing the excess weight in existing CVDs (Hoffmeier et al., 2014; McLean et al., 2008; Vellagaminu et al., 2006). Modifying dietary characteristics is a feasible goal but is underchallenged as a strategy by the public.\nThere is a growing body of evidence linking dietary cholesterol intake to dyslipidemias and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the evidence does not exist to support the recommendation that dietary cholesterol intake be restricted to a level at which the excess risk of CVD is minimized.\nThe public should also be advised to eat a diet high in fibre rich foods. Dietary cholesterol is thought to help to maintain insulin levels normal. However, the role of dietary cholesterol in the initiation and maintenance of atherogenic (fatty) lipid levels has not been definitively established. While there is some preliminary evidence that dietary cholesterol may influence LDL cholesterol and raise plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in men, the effects have not been definitively established (Vellagaminu et al., 2006). Similarly, more studies are needed to inform the public about the benefits (Munz et al., 2006). Dietary fibre provides fibre-soluble nutrients (folic acid, B-carotene and choline) that improve haemoglobin and reduce blood cholesterol levels in the short term (Lu and Li, 2014). While these are well- established mechanisms, more evidence is needed to provide a clear and consistent link with the risk of CVD.\nThe recommended levels for cholesterol reduction in the general population would be:\nHowever, some recommendations make it more challenging to reach 2.2 mmol/L for the general population. It is not known how much cholesterol is excreted in the urine, and the amount varies by genotype of the cholesterol in question.\nDietary fats, such as saturated and trans fats, do not enter the blood. If a person consumes a high fat diet (for example, 1) and takes dietary cholesterol for a week, the blood cholesterol level drops to approximately 10 mmol/L. This level remains relatively stable at a week and does not change during subsequent months of the same participant\u2019s diet.\nDietary cholesterol can be reduced. Although cholesterol is stored in the liver, some cholesterol is released in response to low dietary cholesterol. The risk is increased if the liver is exposed to too much cholesterol in the blood, so the liver needs to work harder to break down cholesterol (Boehm et al., 2019). Although dietary cholesterol does not appear to have a direct effect on the heart rate or other factors associated with CVD, it may be associated with decreased blood flow to the heart.\nIn the past, the advice that some people who are at risk of developing CVD are not advised to engage in lifestyle interventions was based on concerns of dietary cholesterol that are not yet validated (Dunlop et al., 2017). However, the evidence is now clear that low-dose dietary cholesterol is not associated with a significant change in CVD risk. To protect persons at risk of CVD, it is recommended to focus on interventions such as lifestyle changes, as well as maintaining blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels within optimal limits (World Health Organisation, (WHO), 2005a).\nThere is limited evidence of how high dietary cholesterol intake affects serum lipids in adults. If one was given a 1.7 mmol/L total cholesterol control, a study would show that a 22-hour difference in resting heart rate in a coronary artery disease group is not significant, but it would be considered clinically significant if a 1.7 mmol/L level was observed at 23 minutes after consuming a 1.7 mmol/L daily allowance of cholesterol.\nThis is a complex issue that demands that more independent studies be carried out to fully demonstrate whether the cholesterol in this dose was effective at reducing CVD risk in adults. These findings will need to be confirmed before considering recommendations for dietary cholesterol intake", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30.

He is under the influence of the psychoactive drug cocaine with no previous history of addiction. His C-reactive protein level is 3.5 mg/dL and his blood pressure is 160/92 mmHg.\nJohn\u2019s diet and medications have prescribed a Mediterranean diet (Mediterranean) 5 days a week with several food groups. No other dietary alterations are mandatory, but there is a general recommendation of the Mediterranean diet to follow with a special diet for coronary heart disease patients. The main dietary items recommended by the Mediterranean diet are:\n- Lots of fresh fruits and vegetables (3 servings per day)\n- Lots of beans and legumes (4 servings in a day)\n- Lots of fish (3 servings per week)\n- Lots of nuts \u2013 most of them walnut-type, also almonds, Brazil nuts, pecans, hazelnuts, cashews\n- Lots of olive oil, vegetable oil\n- Lots of healthy oily fish (salmon) and sea vegetables\n- Lots of whole grains (bread, rolls, brown rice, millet, oats, barley, brown rice, white rice, couscous, bulgur, spud), or whole wheat spelt\n- Lots of fruit (fruits of all colors)\nIt is considered the best way to avoid heart disease. John\u2019s diet is based on the Mediterranean diet, which is different from the Western diet, the way that people tend to eat and the way that Americans do. When we come to John\u2019s diet, we look for foods that are healthy for his heart. Since most of the studies of John\u2019s diet are done on animals, he will have to take a closer look on how to feed him better, which is important. The studies also point out that John has his own blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, diabetes of 2.8 percent. He has an A1c of 6.7 percent. All other blood parameters are within the lower normal values. If you, as well as John, know that this study is not helpful, no matter that it is a good study, please beware of the studies that use blood tests instead of the food and the diet. The study has some limitations. More importantly, the studies that are based on observational studies are more probable to be biased and affect the results for which the bias is greater. If the research is based on observational studies, the results are probably very accurate. (The researchers have not controlled for potential confounding factors.)\nThe study does not indicate the actual effect of the diet that John has at the end. The study in which it is compared to the Western diet does not include that part. The results only apply to people with no or very low blood pressure. John\u2019s diet does not include foods that lower his blood pressure, though, because the Mediterranean diet only includes the foods with a low calorie. John\u2019s diet does not affect the A1c levels, because they have not been measured and measured, just the blood pressure. Both a high A1c level and a Mediterranean diet, no matter what the exact blood pressure will be, are good and helpful for John. In other words, there is no reason for the research to say that the Mediterranean diet is a bad diet to follow. And the same goes for other weight-loss plans, that diet plan being the best way to follow. The study is important for John\u2019s health, since it finds that the diet reduces his cholesterol, increases his HDL cholesterol, increases his blood pressure and cholesterol, reduces his chances of developing type 2 diabetes, reduces his chances of developing coronary heart disease and most importantly, improves John\u2019s long-term health.", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30.

This information is important to his doctor because hypertension is a known risk factor for CVD.\nI will use the guidelines of the CYP2D6 and COX2 family of enzymes in a molecular biology assay in this research investigation. First, our objective will be to identify the enzyme(s) that make up the CYP2D6/COX2 family using an automated electrophoresis assay to monitor for mutations. A DNA probe that is specific to the CYP2D6/COX2 family would be generated using primers BHK-21-5\u2032\u2013GATAGGTACGCGAGCT-3\u2032 and AACGATGCGAAAGCT-3\u2032. The probe can be visualized with fluorescently labeled DNA probes that have sequence and nucleotide polymorphisms (NPAs). My question is the need for this assay to be highly sensitive in its detection of mutations. The first step to developing the assay that I will use the CYP2D6/COX2 family of enzymes is identifying each enzyme in the COX2 family and then analyzing their expression.\nMy next objectives will be to study the expression of the enzyme OXPHOS in various tissues. This will allow me to examine the different tissue types that are likely to be affected in the case of this patient. I will need to find the CYP2D6 and have it purified or synthesized. In order to do this, an antibody specific to CYP2D6 is required. Next, the assay is intended for the detection of CYP2D6/COX2 family enzymes from a tissue sample that would be obtained from the patient. I will have the specific probe that is designed to find the enzyme in the tissue and that can be used to obtain the CYP2D6/COX2 enzyme of interest.\nThird, my goal is to identify inhibitors of caspase activation using the CYP2D6/COX2 family of enzymes. My specific targets for this research are the enzymes caspase 3, the enzyme caspase 7, and the enzymes in the pathway involved with apoptosis. Currently, the inhibitors of the enzymes caspase 3 and caspase 7 are the focus of a lot of research for cancer. We will use two inhibitors from a pharmaceutical company to develop one of the inhibitors from the CYP2D6/COX2 family of enzymes. The first inhibitor will be an antibody produced using PCR that will be able to detect the CYP2D6 and CYP2D6 isozyme in vivo that has a specificity for the CYP2D6/COX2 family. I have found that there is no direct identification of the CYP2D6 isozyme from the enzyme. I plan to use a genetic screen of the enzymes to identify the CYP2D6 isozyme that is a member of the CYP2D6 family. If the CYP2D6 isozyme is a member of the CYP2D6 family, then I believe that I can use the assay that I will use to detect mutations in that enzyme. The next steps will be to find a CYP2D6 isozyme that binds to both the CYP2D6 and CYP2D6 isozyme and will be able to see if that is an effective assay to detect mutations in this enzyme.", "Please generate cardiovascular disease (CVD) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for John, who is a 70-year-old Chinese male with a BMI of 30.

Find the most current Cardiovascular Disease guidelines from NICE for John at www.nice.org.uk. What is the recommended treatment?\nThe treatment for John is not recommended. To prevent the patient from developing heart disease, NICE recommends lifestyle changes rather than surgery. A reduction of the risk factor, including both lifestyle measures and medication, are the priority at treatment of the condition. What is the most effective approach?\nThe most reliable approach is lifestyle and dietary change to reduce cardiovascular risk for a 100 year old Chinese male with a BMI of 30 and a blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, according to NICE guidelines.\nWhat is NICE Doing Differently?\nNICE has been involved in clinical trial work for the last six years. NICE\u2019s clinical trial programme is part of the WHO platform in Asia and to the point of doing systematic reviews, and we have also participated in the study of several Asian countries, including Thailand, Vietnam, China, and Japan.\nIn the Asian context, Singapore and Hong Kong have successfully carried out two large clinical trials of the TAG-EDA in the framework of the National Heart and Lung Institute. In the Chinese context, we believe that NICE\u2019s clinical trial programme is also playing different roles, with TAG-EDA and a joint trial in the Chinese context, and TAG-EDA being part of another clinical trial in the context of NHL.\nNICE is also trying to build on previous clinical trials in the context of the National Heart Institute. NHL has had clinical trials in Thailand, Vietnam, and Japan. The NHL\u2019s main clinical trials are R20 (5) and T2, where T20 is for atrial fibrillation. In NHL\u2019s trial, the authors have to confirm the findings of those studies and give their confidence for the trial results.\nWhat is TACT and why is it important for us is the part of the NICE clinical trial programme that is in the Asia context?\nIn addition to the trial of TAG-EDA in Singapore and the trial of TAG-EDA in Hong Kong, we are also part of a research project at the National Heart Institute. TACT is an international open-label study that will be a part of NICE clinical trial programme. It is also part of our long-term programme of developing cardiac biomarkers that will be used as predictors for the prognosis.\nWho are the stakeholders of TACT?\nThe stakeholder group at the NHL is from the NHL community. They are:\n- The primary end of care team\n- The Primary Research Team (R22)\n- The Primary Research Team-in-Chief: Dr. Lian Li\n- The primary care team (R23)\n- The public in charge of the research\n- All the stakeholders at that level of care (R26)\nFrom WHO: Why is it important to build on our clinical trial experience and to bring some new results back from that experience?\nNICE is currently running the TAG-EDA multicentric trial in the context of the NHL\u2019s trial. This is a trial to test the effectiveness of the GSM-408 for the treatment of secondary heart failure. We know very well that with these clinical trial results, a larger programme will be created. If we get a better result, there are huge opportunities: for example, if we can get a better result, we will be using TACT as an independent trial to do other clinical trials.\nFrom the NHL: We are currently reviewing the TACT results, whether to improve it.\nWhat is the research programme and what is being done?\nThe NT-SNET project focuses on a group of volunteers with advanced secondary heart failure of 20 years and 70 years of life, such that the treatment for both groups is currently the same. We are also working on a group of people, in the same age range, with an advanced heart failure (ALHF) and patients with advanced primary heart disease (ALPHD), who have a good outcome despite other clinical trial results. It is a trial to find out if improving the treatment of early ALHF will improve the outcome of adults with ALHF.

What type of diet would he be advised on? What recommendations would he be making? What dietary pattern would he be following, and in what circumstances would he want to restrict or increase his intake of fibre? How much salt and saturated fat would he be exposed to during the course of his visit? Does he need to be told that he's being put on a low-fat diet or advised to avoid saturated fat, whereas the usual 'no-fats' diet would be given? (The reason I am posting this is because I am going to be giving my 24-year-old daughter a talk based on what she has found out as the result of her visit, and in particular, she said she found it difficult to understand what I had told her. That's why I'm posting this in the hope that I can educate her about her condition and how it's affecting her health.) John is 6 years old, male, over 40 years, overweight. He's 14 years old. (He has been in his care for about 9 years, and has had to be placed in multiple wards (after two admissions in 2011), he has a family history of CVD - diabetes, which is a life-long condition, and he has hypertension, stroke, and a large family history of coronary heart disease.) At the point we visited him, he had no obvious physical symptoms (which should surprise you that it's normal!). The doctors wanted to discuss possible changes to his diet.\nJohn's current weight in kg. The BMI at the time of his visit was: weight (kg): 149.3. The BMI at the time of his visit was: weight: 177.5. The BMI was 14.6 for the year after his visit (2010) as it was used to predict future BMI in previous clients, as well as the BMI calculated in Year 0 on his previous visits.\nHe has a family history of CVD. At the time of his visit, his father, his grandfather, his brother and his mother all lived with chronic illnesses as an adult. Therefore, the blood pressure readings he recorded are not normal for that age group, and the fasting blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and total cholesterol are not normal for that age group.\nJohn's age at admission. John's age at admission is 10. John's age at admission is a 12-year-old boy. When you write your BMI or average blood pressure or total cholesterol, there is no age given, however, due to the age and weight of the child, we will assume that John's age is 6.\nThe results of the health examinations that you have had for him. The results from your visits showed that he had not developed any previous cardiovascular conditions and that he was in excellent health in terms of his blood pressure and cholesterol and not yet on any medication. Therefore, we have not been able to conclude anything about his history of CVD and coronary heart disease.\nThe diet that John follows. John's diet is not rich in added fats and salt, and rather light in carbohydrates, so he has a normal dietary intake of protein which is low in carbohydrates, and he still eats a high number of foods that we would recommend in the UK diet. He eats a variety of fruit and vegetables, and eats a varied diet of meat, fish and dairy products, in addition to bread, breakfast cereals, pasta, nuts and potatoes. The meal was low on added fats, high on carbohydrates, and was low in salt, and he has no known heart problem.

The guidelines are based on a 2018 study from the US National Institutes of Health that found that the standard of care for people with CVD should be a 20 kg lower BMI. This is the same guideline that the US government uses in the US Heart Association's advice on what weight to gain for healthy, normal weight people.\nWhat is the NICE guidance for age-appropriate weight-to-height comparison?\nIt is a weight-to-height comparison based on the 'healthy weight' definition that you should consider using. It is based on what the 2014 UK National Screening Committee Report from the UK Health Service Executive did.\nThe research said: The guideline guidelines for weight and height comparison for healthy people and to people with or at-risk of CVD included a low BMI but no weight to height comparison. This level of recommendation was deemed 'appropriate' in the context of the WHO advice on healthy, normal weight people and the recommendations in this guide were to be implemented if you want the guidance for healthy, normal weight people to be more specific and clear.\nThe NICE guidance requires the follow-up of people if their weight or height is more than 23 inches or 111 mm or more.\nWhat does the NICE guidance say?\nThe NICE guidance is: \"To identify people with a healthy body mass or height, this guide uses the 'healthy weight' definition based on the Healthy Weight Guide and BMI. To evaluate someone's weight and height, this guide uses the (healthy weight) BMI and other criteria to identify a healthy weight, when they have enough muscle mass to maintain a current normal body weight. The BMI is based on the most widely accepted method for measuring weight-to-height ratio (BMI), so that the BMI is 0.89 or below for children < 8.5 years. It is a standard for measuring weight-to-height ratio and should be applied to children aged <5 years without specific guidelines.\"\nThe BMI calculator is as of 2017. If the BMI is 24.5 or higher, the BMI guideline does not have a target height. If the BMI is 25.4 or higher, however, the BMI may suggest a person has a low risk of CVD.\nAs a general guideline and as the guidelines have been amended in a few years, the guidelines are likely to change and the guidance may change over time.\nWhat else do these guidelines cover?\nYou need to be at least 20kg for healthy weight to be 23 inches or 29.5 cm in height. This is defined as having 1/3ile fat on the top of the neck or a 3/4 of the chest to fit into the smaller side chest space.\nThe guide says the BMI calculator can also be used if the BMI is less than 17.\nThe NICE guideline also advises, \"Having a healthy body mass index (BMI) is the best way to reduce your risk of CVD or health conditions such as type 2 diabetes or heart disease.\"\nHowever, the guide says the age-appropriate weight-to-height comparison does not give you an accurate measure of a person's BMI or height, as BMI does not take into consideration factors such as muscle, bone, fat, and fat-free mass (the amount of fat that you have attached to your skin). Instead, it focuses on overall body fat to estimate a person's BMI and height. This guideline also excludes factors, such as BMI, that are associated with CVD, such as smoking, high cholesterol, or diabetes.\nAlso, your doctor or health professional may use BMI. BMI is commonly used in medicine and cardiology to measure BMI. However, it is important to discuss the potential limitations of using BMI when comparing height and weight.\nWhat is the difference between BMI and Body Mass Index (BMI)?\nBMI can be used to help measure the healthy weight of a person. BMI is a measurement of body fat based on the amount of fat attached, including visceral fat visceral fat. But this does not account for muscle, bone, and fat, which have different health effects.\nBMI is calculated as follows:\n|Body mass index||2x BMI/height|\n|BMI||(body weight \u00f7 height2)2||0.5|\n|BMI = body weight \u00f7 height 2||0.5|\nThe 1.25-kg weight is recommended for healthy middle-aged and older men.

The questions have been designed to meet NICE clinical guidelines, particularly the Q90.24, for the management of acute myocardial infarction and/or stable angina, acute coronary syndrome, and the assessment, management and follow up of patients with severe CVD as well as acute stroke (CHF) in patients aged 30 to 64 (see the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) practice guideline on acute stroke (Q90.24) in this publication). This paper is an important contribution to NICE practice and will be read in conjunction with the relevant NICE documents.\nOur objective with this QC questionnaire is to provide the most useful information on any subject, within a relatively short period of time. It is a simple and yet powerful questionnaire. If we are able to capture the entire spectrum of information, the answers can be refined into a structured questionnaire. The purpose of this questionnaire is to give a brief snapshot of any particular disease or disorder, at a particular time, so that we can provide the latest guidelines.\nWe designed this questionnaire because, in many practice settings (including Europe), it has not been possible to conduct a thorough questionnaire survey on CVD care, particularly for a representative sample of patients. Because of the recent advances in NICE quality assurance, this QC questionnaire design should be replicated, and the results included updated to the time of this study.\nThis QC questionnaire was designed for a very large sample of patients. With this in mind, the questionnaire has been translated into multiple languages and will be translated into English as well as French. We have ensured that the most appropriate questions are in the appropriate language and language are used - as opposed to multiple languages. Questions about the clinical and physical characteristics of patients is also included.\nThe questionnaire contains several sections. The first section will be devoted to answering \"What is the cause of my patient\u2019s heart disease, or CVD?\". This will require a broad understanding of a clinical problem, as well as providing a range of questions to be asked for each patient in the question.\nThe following questions provide information on a subset of risk factors for CVD in different age groups. It is important that we include questions addressing those people when assessing risk of CVD. Question 6 is especially important. It asks the patient, \"Is there an increased risk of cardiovascular disease? Why do you think there might be?\". This subsection will need further investigation to determine whether there is a relationship between risk factors and a positive or negative diagnosis of CVD in this patient group.\nQuestion 8 asks about smoking, alcohol intake, and other factors that may appear protective in CVD patients, but not in patients with diabetes or a history of hypertension. \"Does your smoking (or number of cigarettes) make your heart, or your blood vessels, more likely to form clots that lodge in your arteries?\" is another question that would require further investigation.\nQuestion 9, \"Does your smoking, alcohol consumption, and use of tobacco products change the risk of CVD, or CVD risk in this patient group?\" is another question. The patient has told us the age they used to smoke, or how many cigarettes they used yesterday, but asked about changing their current levels of smoking or using tobacco products. The patient asked if they ever used cigarettes or other tobacco products and it is possible that this may contribute to the risk of CVD in this patient group.\nIn this section we want to have information on the clinical picture of the person as well as their history of other cardiovascular risk factors. This might be the result of a recent medical consultation as they were examined, or it may be that this person has had a recent heart attack. We want to include information relating to the history of cardiovascular symptoms.\nQuestion 14 involves asking about recent lifestyle changes. A recent change may include a new job or an appointment with a physician.

So we had to understand that age, he may have been able to live out the rest of his life with less health complications.\nSo, I tried to get a proper diabetes management program but I had many questions:\nHow much insulin should I be taking?\nIf what you read makes sense, is it really safe?\nIf the patient has any complications, are there any precautions you would be taking?\nIf we only gave him a new \"heart weight,\" was he OK?\nIf you're trying to get someone down, are there special techniques or things they can learn to better your understanding like coping skills, communication skills, ways to stay healthy and so on?\nThe best answer is \"I hope everyone can learn from this one,\" and I look forward to any questions and comments in the future.\nI am an internist and I am a native speaker in the US and have lived in South America where my health is very fragile due to diabetes and the high level of stress is the one of my worst diseases as well as the people with diabetes have to cope with. We are a very sensitive group. I have been part of many medical clinics and in these medical clinics it is not easy to say we are doing well and then there is always a high level stress. And so, every day I see patients dealing with different health problems and I see what is good for them, what isn't for them, how well fit they are, what kind of lifestyle are they able to lead and what's the best care that we can give to them.

Please explain.\n(7) An obese patient in a long standing cardiac disease clinic was recently referred to the emergency department for an admission for sudden death. The patient did not have a known coronary artery disease, and his health status was reported as good while at the hospital. The patient's previous cardiac history includes a history of high blood pressure. What would be your first step in determining whether to refer the patient for angiography or diagnostic procedures? Explain.\nThe NICE Guidelines on Primary Care\nGuidelines for Primary Care\nThe primary (or \"core\") care for any patient over the age of 16 is often referred to as \"usual care.\" Most patients at this age are referred to a primary care physician, but the need for specific primary care care is a growing concern particularly in the UK. Primary care is also referred to as \"secondary care.\" \"Secondary\" in primary care is often used when referring to the diagnosis and treatment of \"recent illnesses\" such as an acute myocardial infarction.\nThe NICE guideline in its latest publication is for primary care. If primary care is not indicated, secondary care is recommended.", "Considering John's demographics and health status - a 70-year-old Chinese male, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, free of diabetes, with a family history of CVD - what would be the NICE CVD guidelines applicable to him?\nA 35-year-old man of Mediterranean American ancestry, BMI of 53, hemoglobin A1C of 9.1%, diabetes - 301/35 mmHg, total cholesterol of 4.08 mmol/L, total protein content of 39 mg/dL. What clinical advice would you give for the individual?\nWe can be certain there is not a single answer to this question that will give the entire health of any patient exactly the same results. A patient's ideal diagnosis of CVD is to have a very high number of CHD or coronary artery calcium which indicates coronary artery narrowing or occlusion. This kind of CHD may mean that other cardiovascular patients do not have the same problems as the person who has CHD. It is important to rule out other diseases that have the same signs as the patient who has coronary disease.\nThe following are examples of CHD signs:\n- Swelling of the feet or toes - the swelling of the legs (vasculitis)\nThe above are some of the signs that are considered to be \"normal\" or \"normal\" for a person with coronary disease.\nThe next three are not.\nThe presence of angina or peripheral chest pain may also be a warning sign of coronary disease, but when is the diagnosis of coronary disease important?\nA person should not feel the pain that accompanies coronary disease just in the chest area. Chest pain that is persistent and cannot be explained by anything other than cardiac disease may be due to heart failure.\nA person experiences dizziness, light headedness, and a racing heart. It is a \"premature\" diagnosis, in the sense that the patient should expect cardiac arrest when she experiences the above symptoms associated with \"heart failure\". A person who is experiencing symptoms of cardiac arrest should be evaluated by a physician.\nA person who has coronary disease and has no indications of heart disease should receive treatment for the cause of his abnormal cardiac exercise. If he has no cause for the abnormal exercise, he will not need urgent treatment.\nA person with symptoms of coronary disease, including angina, may receive a cardiac catheterization instead of being treated with medication, or they may have their heart allowed to work less severely to allow coronary disease to better resolve itself. This type of treatment involves using catheters instead of medications to open the coronary arteries. After being treated aggressively, this patient will be able to enjoy a life of 100% quality of sleep.\nIs \"heart failure\" a term, or an indication of heart damage, or is the heart \"aging\"?\nThe heart is the most efficient body organ. Once a person's heart is damaged, the person is unable to maintain their high oxygen-carrying capacity. He has to rely on the lungs to breathe normally, and the remaining tissue in his body is weakened. The symptoms of his condition are that his blood pressure drops which causes dizziness or nausea, and his breathing becomes labored. Heart failure has other indications as well, such as swelling of the ankles and feet - edema - of the lining of the lungs, or swollen legs.\nIs cardiologist an abbreviation or abbreviation of cardiologist?\nCardiologist is the American term for cardiologist, or cardiologic specialists. American cardiologists have a number of specialties, including pulmonary, cardiovascular, and kidney. The prefix \"cardiology\" is used to refer to diseases or conditions involving the heart and blood vessels.\nCan a person have CVD without any signs of heart disease?\nThere are no specific signs that indicate a serious underlying cause of myocardial infarction and heart disease.\nCan an \"active\" CHD be cured?\nTo be cured of a CHD is difficult, since there are so many variables involved. People with a heart disease may have no symptom in the acute phase of the illness, and they may die at 1 to 3 months after the diagnosis of the disease. This situation is called the \"sudden death syndrome.\"\nWhat are the best methods for managing a patient with CHD?\nPatient-centered guidelines include a physical therapist and the patient as their first doctor. Patients with CHD may need a second physician or a team consisting of an occupational therapist, physical therapist, cardiologist, cardiologist, dietitian, and doctor. Some individuals may require hospitalization for oxygen therapy or a feeding tube, for which appropriate health care facilities include:\n- Hospital emergency departments\n- Cardiac care\n- Community nursing homes\nPatients may have difficulty accepting the concept of CHD as a treatable condition. There are physical, pharmacological, and psychosocial issues involved in coping with cardiovascular", "Considering John's demographics and health status - a 70-year-old Chinese male, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, free of diabetes, with a family history of CVD - what would be the NICE CVD guidelines applicable to him?\n\nHere's my attempt at the question:\n\n1. If his total cholesterol level is 140, what percentage will he deal with blood pressure?\n\nFirst let's focus on the general advice given in the ACC/AHA/EUS guidelines. The first thing to do is take your BP reading (if you're having trouble in finding it by your nearest or farther office, ask one - it would be a very good idea to use the bathroom first if you can and never wait for your blood pressure monitor to be flushed).\n\n10. What is the goal for the blood pressure measured by these numbers?\n\n11. The goal for the blood pressure measured by these numbers is\n\na) To reduce diastolic pressure\n\nb) To reduce systolic pressure\n\nc) To reduce total systolic pressure\n\nd) To reduce diastolic pressure/total pressure\n\ne) To obtain a \"target blood pressure\" of 120-129.9 (not to exceed 130-139.9 or >140). Is this correct?\n\n11. The goal for the blood pressure measured by these numbers is\n\na) To reduce systolic pressure\n\nb) To reduce diastolic pressure\n\nc) To reduce diastolic pressure/total pressure\n\nd) To obtain a \"target blood pressure\" of 130-118.9 kph (55-59.92).\n\n11. The goal for the blood pressure measured by these numbers is\n\na) To reduce diastolic pressure\n\nb) To reduce systolic pressure\n\nc) To reduce total systolic pressure\n\nd) To obtain a \"target blood pressure\" of 116-111.9kph (60-68.48).\n\n12. Which combination of blood pressure readings do you find most appropriate for a patient that is 65, 100 mmHg above normal? Explain.\n\n13. Find two values for the left and right foot when performing:\n\n14. The systolic pressure is 140 mmhg and the diastolic pressure is 130 mmhg. Determine your target systolic and diastolic pressures when the readings are:\n\n15. For women and men, what percentage do you consider to be within the upper and lower limit of a desirable blood pressure? Why?\n\nNote I am using the term \"adequate\", because it is assumed that systolic, diastolic and blood pressure for all healthy people are \"adequate\". If your blood pressure goes above 140 over a duration of more than 24 hours, you need to assess your blood pressure again. This has been shown to raise your odds of developing cardiovascular disease!\n\nYou do need to know your ideal systolic and diastolic blood pressure, even if you are an average male or female. The normal range depends on age. This calculation for adult females is 140 \u2013 190, for adult males is 151 \u2013 170. Note that adult males are slightly heavier.\n\nThere are lots of blood pressure blood tests in practice. You must know your blood pressure numbers to safely use them in your blood pressure monitoring. Blood pressure blood testing is considered one of the most important medical tests because it is an accurate way to measure your blood pressure over a period of time. This can help to identify people who need to be screened for a possible vascular (heart) disease such as cardiovascular disease/stroke. Although blood pressure readings are checked every few weeks, the results are tested more often in the last few months, especially in older men and women.\n\nTo prevent heart and vascular diseases, your readings need to be measured consistently on a regular basis.\n\nBlood pressure is one of the many health indicators used by hospitals, clinics, and health care teams to evaluate the physical and psychological well-being and physical health of their patients. Blood pressure is commonly used to check for various heart conditions within patients, such as hypertension.\n\nWhat is the normal BP level for patients suffering from cardiovascular disease?\n\nThe goal for a normal BP level is below 90mmHg, which is often designated to be 90/60 mmHg (or 90/60/60/60)\n\nIf your blood pressure is 140/90mmHg or more, you may have high blood pressure or hypertension.\n\nHypercholesterolemia is a common diagnosis in most health care scenarios.", "Considering John's demographics and health status - a 70-year-old Chinese male, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, free of diabetes, with a family history of CVD - what would be the NICE CVD guidelines applicable to him?\n\n---\n\nFrom my experience, these questions have sometimes resulted in me being told things that aren't necessarily helpful or necessary, resulting in worse health outcomes. For instance, if someone says they have hypertension, but doesn't manage it well, their condition could worsen over time leading them to develop kidney problems, heart disease, stroke, etc.\n\nThis doesn't help anyone because it makes them feel worse throughout their lives while it may actually save them years of potential suffering and even happiness.\n\nAs someone who understands both the importance of self-care and the importance of getting support, I feel frustrated that the same guidelines aren't being followed. They aren't promoting change for individuals; they encourage fear and neglect of serious issues like mental health, learning disabilities, and substance abuse. While many cases can be tackled independently (e.g., therapy, medication management), not everything can be addressed without considering potential long-term consequences.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding NICE guidelines is crucial but recognizing their limitations can be more beneficial, especially when used to guide people dealing with chronic medical conditions.

Of these, 17,870 (5%) cause fatal injuries and the remaining 27,030 are non-fatal. This figure is even higher for those transported by bicycle than the road cycle: 496 million (almost 10% of all road journeys by bicycle) and 340 million (almost 10% of all road journeys by bicycle) are carried by bicycle in the country.\nMost of them are people aged 50 or above, and 69% were women.

Which of these recommendations do you believe is consistent with one another?\nA 70-year-old man may score 1 to 3 as poor on a screening tool evaluating risk for diabetes, while over 40 may score 4 or 5 according to the NICE guidelines. An NICE guideline statement for CVD prevention, by its very nature, is based on well-established evidence.\nThat said, when it comes to age, there are a number of ways to measure CVD. Generally a blood pressure >130/88 mmHg is a high risk, a history of smoking > 25 cigarettes a day, or diabetes in people age 65 years or older is even higher, or a history of heart failure can point you to potentially serious concerns, such as a weak immune system.\nWhile smoking is a risk, there are also many other CVD factors that may be on the horizon. For example an HbA1c of 6.0%, a history of obesity or other types of metabolism related diseases, and previous CVD episodes including an ACE inhibitor, could all have a positive effect on the overall impact of a healthy lifestyle on heart health. While it is likely that these factors will have a beneficial effect overall, it is important to remember that they aren\u2019t the only factors that may be associated with CVD risk, and some people may have a low baseline risk, and still have high CV risk. So whether anyone is at risk for CVD will be based on several factors, as well as lifestyle changes, and ultimately management of their disease.", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him? How can the best possible interventions for future CVD prevention improve the likelihood of these outcomes?\nA heart attack, also known as acute coronary syndrome, can occur suddenly, such as in someone who has low-risk factors or a family history of heart disease. In that case, medications called \"staves\" (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory substances -- a group of potentially dangerous drugs used to prevent arthritis) that inhibit the body's own inflammatory response are used and will treat the pain of a heart attack by reducing the heart's workload while keeping blood flow to the heart normal so that symptoms will stop.\nThe NHS guidelines are based on the risk factors (see, e.g. Wilkinson and Lewis, 2004, p.2) of atherosclerosis (coronary heart disease) or cardiovascular disease and the major contributing causes (see, e.g. Farrar and McCurtain, 1997, p.13). Both factors are associated with the occurrence of new or continuing fatal heart attacks because the heart needs to pump blood full-load for each heart contraction.\nIf someone's medical history is clear, he or she can be referred to the appropriate public health organisation and treated or referred to the appropriate cardiology care service.\nThe most prominent cause of new heart attacks is a blood clot in the heart artery (see, e.g. Davies and Smith, 1996, p.198 and Schluter, 2005, p.253-254). In some groups, such as those with high cholesterol (Preeclampsia, type II diabetes, and family history of diabetes) where coronary heart disease is very high, thrombi can form in the heart artery, which may rupture and damage the heart. This may prevent blood flow across the heart muscle or cause infarction, where the heart muscle is permanently damaged (e.g. in a myocardial infarction - a heart attack).\nIn the case of heart disease related death, coronary heart disease - e.g. angina pectoris - can be the cause. Another possibility is where the heart muscle is damaged and causes a failure of the pump, which then reduces blood flow through the heart.\nIf someone's medical history is clear but has no clear risk factors, this means a person has a high-risk lifestyle: smoking and alcohol consumption, hypertension, an aorto-cathartic problem, sedentary lifestyle and poor diet in general, such as an eating diet (diet high in animal products), lack of exercise for at least 20 minutes every day, or over-indulgence on fatty food. So, this group of individuals is at high risk of heart disease (e.g. atherosclerosis or angina pectoris).\nThe NHS guideline sets out the lifestyle recommendations for every individual in the group and they include the following:\n* a healthy diet (a low-calorie, high-fat diet reduces the risk of coronary heart disease);\n* a low-fat diet (e.g. the National Diet and Nutrition Survey on Diet and Health, 1999);\n* an exercise program (at least 10 weekly minutes; a moderate intensity activity);\n* quitting smoking at the earliest opportunity;\n* a moderate alcohol intake (4-5 drinks a week);\n* less hours of sedentary activity (excessive TV watching, less outdoor time, less leisure time); and,\n* reducing alcohol and smoking in daily life (the National Diet and Nutrition Survey shows that only one third of all British adults are aware that they are to be aware of the risks of tobacco; and the next best prevention is drinking less, especially alcohol).\nHowever, this is not a recommendation (usually) written in the literature or research literature, with the main emphasis being the personal care and protection of the individual during exercise.\nIf someone's medical history is clear, but has no risk factors (hypertension, obesity, smoking, poor diet, etc.), this means he or she will benefit from treatment with 'active' cardiovascular medicine (e.g. drugs to enhance the heart pumping function) which are often recommended with active exercise (e.g. e.g. statins). If someone's medical history shows the need to receive help to exercise, it is recommended that this is done over 6 months in the hope and by a close examination of the person, the need for these drugs can be found.\nIf someone's 'active' (rather than 'active cardiovascular)' medicine will not work and they choose to receive help to", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?

These recommendations should be based on an individual\u2019s experience and preferences and should not be imposed by others. This approach assumes no prior history and is likely to provide a better plan of action than patients\u2019 current preferences and expectations.\n\nThe following examples illustrate the use of PBM in predicting risk of CVD for both the pre- and post-intervention populations:\n\n Case A: The person is 66 years-old with a history of atherosclerosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia (C,HDL, cholesterol, blood glucose, cholesterol, fibrinogen, triglyceride, vitamin D), sleep apnea, and diabetes, which have all predispositions; the person has not smoked and is a \u201cnormal-risk\u201d or \u201cuntimely\u201d patient. Case B: The person has been a patient for 41 years, an elderly history who has no previous heart disease or stroke history, history of high cholesterol, heart disease or stroke, history of alcohol-induced heart failure, high blood sugar, diabetes, and diabetes medication history. (The case describes a person not to smoke or at risk for developing obesity.) Case C: The person is a \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cuntimely\u201d patient who does not have diabetes or stroke history, no prior history of heart disease or stroke, no smoking, high blood sugar, hypertension, high cholesterol, LDL, HDL, fasting blood sugar, triglyceride, free radical, fibrinogen, fibrinogen, high-sensitivity 17-hydroxy- sitosterol, and vitamin E levels. (The case describes a person who has no prior history of CVD, high triglycerides, high LDL, and diabetes blood sugar levels, has a low-sensitivity 17-hydroxy- sitosterol.) The person should be considered a lower risk of CVD. In conclusion, the pre- and postintervention PBM is the best method to evaluate the relative risk (i.e., lower risk for CVD) of the candidate for exercise intervention (Figure 3) [13, 31, 30].\n\nFigure 4.\n\nThe PBM with the most accurate predictions of risk to the pre- and post-intervention population as a function of duration of exercise (Figure 4).\n\nb\n\nWhat happens during the PBM?\n\n13\n\nd\n\nDo PBMs predict CVD or avoid CVD?\n\na\n\nB\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nDo PBMs predict CV or avoid CV?\n\n23\n\ne\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nUseful information for PBM\n\nFigure 5.\n\nThe most important factors affecting the relationship between PBM and CVD and their interactions.\n\ne\n\nThe three important factors in the relationship between PBM and CVD and their interactions.\n\nThe following information applies to your situation:\n\nThe three important factors in the relationship between PBM and CV, their interactions:\n\n1\n\nThe first factor is time, time 23\n\nThe second factor is duration 23\n\nThe third factor is severity 29\n\n1\n\nthe first factor is time, time 21\n\nThe second factor is duration ", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?

One NICE panel member, Dr. Patrick J Clements, told me about a clinical trial with two hospitals in the US where 150 patients could be selected within 10 days and their blood pressure and serum homocysteine levels monitored over a period of 26 months. If these patients had already had a heart attack, the risk of heart attack was significantly lower without a low-risk cardiovascular risk and the risk of stroke if the participant had a history of a stroke or a previous heart attack.\nThat is an intriguing example of the ability of NICE guidelines to move toward evidence through a rigorous use of a data set and a process of cross-validation. And this does not just apply to the blood pressure: the NICE guideline for blood pressure noted above is the result of a rigorous review of population-level data in 4,977 elderly, non-fatal, white men and women in 21 European countries. The same population-wide data set was used in the 2008 study to predict whether or not a 60-year-old man with hypertension is at high-risk for a cardiovascular event (high-risk cardiovascular risk). A review of the 2008 study revealed that the prevalence of hypertension (as measured with validated instruments such as the Hamilton Hypertension Scale), stroke (using an adapted version of the Hamilton Strokes Index devised in Germany and widely used for screening and risk prediction), and death from cardiovascular causes could be estimated by the high-risk hypertension (HRA) category, or the presence of specific cardiovascular risk factors (as identified in the 2008 study), on a 0.05 level, without regard to the patient\u2019s ethnicity.\nIt should be noted that the guidelines for CVD screening in the US are based on hypertension prevalence data in 75,000 patients from the 2006 NHANES and on the mortality data in 24,000 cancer and heart disease patients from the NHANES. A large panel of 589 US centers has been used for this study. If they are able to find an effect that is highly relevant and relevant for the US population based on the 2008 study, then the US population-wide data set could be used for subsequent follow-up studies, and it is possible \u2013 and most likely \u2013 that future trials like this could be published with the American Heart Association\u2019s 2013 guidelines. And the same is not true if they are able to find no effect by chance.\nWhat other interventions should be funded that may result in significant reductions in hypertension and strokes?\nThe 2009 guidelines that came out, the 2009 \u201cGuidelines for Screening and the Management of High-Risk Cardiovascular Diseases\u201d identified five interventions that could be used to decrease risks for cardiovascular disease. One of these initiatives, which was developed using the NHANES data set, was to use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute\u2019s definition of the Framingham Heart Study as a model for how to apply these five interventions to each of 12 different regions of the United States in which the risk of cardiovascular events were at or above 300%.\nWhat other interventions could be used? There are a number of ways that could be applied that may lower the incidence of cardiovascular disease: using the Framingham data to develop a risk index for individuals with hypertension, limiting their high intake of saturated fats and keeping their cholesterol levels at more than 250 mg/dL, and stopping lifestyle modi\ufb01cations, such as smoking, if someone has a high or normal LDL-C level or smoking, and so on. There are also interventions that could be applied like a \u201cdose-response\u201d method, such as lowering your blood pressure to a level where you still feel the benefit of not having high-risk disease. And it would be good to explore the possibilities of a potential high-purity blood-thirsty drug as a potential intervention.\nNICE recommends that you talk with your doctor about the need for treatment of high-risk cardiovascular diseases (including hypertension) and consider whether the recommendations in this guidelines are a good fit for you", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\nNo more than 30% of the population have high risk of CVD: most likely the risk cannot be changed, high blood pressure, smoking, blood cholesterol level, physical exercise and other lifestyle factors can make a difference.\nI could not recommend a specific dietary supplement for individuals suffering from high risk CVD.\nI would recommend the Mediterranean diet as one of the components of a healthy lifestyle that has been associated with reduced mortality. It includes: red meat and high intensity aerobic activity; nuts and vegetable oils; few processed foods; fruits, vegetables, whole grains; moderate red meat and dairy intake; moderate amount of alcohol. You can start eating a plant-based diet, but it is a great idea to supplement with a multivitamin containing B vitamins.\nThe most important thing is that individuals who are active should do so, but do not smoke. They should increase their physical activity. As for exercising, not many people know how to do it and most people ignore it. Exercise also helps reduce weight, but be careful to understand that the weight loss does not always translate into weight. It\u2019s easy to get carried away and then become lazy, but if you only exercise for a few minutes three times a week, then you\u2019ll notice a big difference. It is estimated that this program is 60% of the benefits for lowering heart disease and reducing death of age 50 or older, according to research presented at the American Heart Association Congress in San Francisco, CA\nAs for supplements \u2013 there is nothing to be ashamed of. But only when doing them must be careful as many supplements are not recommended for people with cardiovascular diseases. Most are cholesterol-lowering. But one should beware about the ones that treat the other way round: they seem to lower blood sugar. And even if it means the opposite, they can easily be harmful for those with diabetes. So, it is always necessary to choose the best product for its function.\nI am sorry to hear a lot about this situation and to find out that most healthy people do not eat as much as their cholesterol, according to ICS. The answer would have been more helpful, just now that the statistics seem to be the same.\nAs for supplements, I hope I\u2019ve solved the problem and that I have given the tips you need to achieve your heart health goals.\nI wish you all good health and good health!\nI am a freelance writer with a BA in English and an MS in Applied Psychology.

For example, if you have type 2 diabetes, if you know that you are at increased risk for CVD, can you still have a family history of CVD if you were born with a high risk of CVD? So far, I don\u2019t get the idea that having a family history of CVD if you have type 2 diabetes is a no-go. And I find the NICE guidelines are pretty clear on exactly how high your risk is, but the recommendation, if provided to your doctor, is that you follow the guideline to live an especially healthy life. I\u2019m so concerned about my family history of CVD because it raises things up to my own doctor.\nWhat about you?\nTo get more personalized and specific information about how your family history can impact your risk for CVD, I ask you to do the following:\nA. To make sure that you get the recommendation from your doctor\n- See your own doctor\u2019s recommendations for your specific family history\n- Make sure that you meet with another doctor\u2019s recommendations, even if you are not a family member of yours. This is a really tough conversation to have, because there is no such thing as family history before age 18. But make sure you get to a doctor\u2019s report about your family\u2019s individual circumstances, no matter what that means to you.\nB. Make sure that you are meeting with your own doctor\u2019s recommendations, even if you are not part of your family\u2019s history. If you do not meet a specific recommendation (such as not smoking) a conversation with your family doctor can help you with that as well.\nC. Make sure if your doctor approves of the suggestions in the recommendations he/she can provide you, they can then share their own recommendation on how to help you live a healthier life.", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\n- NICE\u2019s guidance recommends starting a dietary pattern and lifestyle intervention to slow down CVD, without medications. It does not specifically recommend a high-potassium diet or limiting sodium intake to below 2,000 mmol/day. It does not mention a low-fat diet, moderate-to-high-moderate-to-low-sugar, and/or low-sodium diet (with sodium intake under 2,000 mmol/day).\n- The consensus statement is that a healthy lifestyle should begin with weight loss as a first line of intervention for heart disease prevention.\nWhat changes and modifications could I see if needed to support my decision?\nRecommendations for further follow-up, if needed:\n- Your health-care provider will recommend that you continue to live a healthy lifestyle, such as having 15\u201325 minutes of exercise (and no more than 15 times a week) and eat a healthy diet, with limiting or cutting back on cholesterol and saturated fats. For a low-sodium diet, try to have up to 2 pounds less sodium each week. It\u2019s important to have food from a variety of sources, which includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, and plant-based protein like tofu and soy milk.\n- If you are diagnosed with diabetes, take insulin shots while you are keeping blood glucose under control. This will help manage your blood pressure. For a high-potassium diet, try to replace other foods with a low- or no-potassium diet (e.g. vegetables cooked with a little acid).\n- For a low-visceral fat diet, try to consume smaller meals throughout the day rather than having two big meals. Having these two large meals daily is a high-risk situation and needs monitoring by a PMS health care provider.\n- For a low-sodium diet, try to eat 7-10 percent less sodium each day, like in small portions. These don\u2019t need to be replacement foods.\n- For a diet that decreases intake of trans fatty acids (trans fat), including plant oils, or omega-3s, but limits fats in very small amounts of food, you may add omega-3 or fish oil supplements. It\u2019s important for you to talk to your PMS health care provider about the type of omega-3 supplement that is right for you. You should be able to manage your cholesterol and blood pressure with exercise. It doesn\u2019t help if cholesterol and blood pressure stay high or go too low.\n- A low-fat diet with moderate sodium intake can help reduce your risk for high blood pressure. To make it easier to add the tips to your list, you should eat at least two servings a day of fruits and vegetables, and at least three servings a day of meat and fish. This gives the whole plate a variety of foods, all of which have healthy unsaturated fats.\n- A higher intake of fruits and vegetables and the right kinds of fats are linked to lower levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or the good cholesterol.\n- A diet rich in beans, whole grains, fish and poultry or low amount of red meats, and low-fat dairy products helps lower blood pressure levels.\n- It\u2019s never too late for you to have healthy eating habits. If you are diagnosed with diabetes, losing around 10 pounds can reduce your risk for heart disease later on.\n- It\u2019s a challenge, especially for young, overweight people, to make healthier choices for yourself.

So there is not a large set of CVD risk factors that need to be controlled, including these risk factors for type 2 diabetes.\nNICE recommends a 45-99% reduction in CVD risk factors when NICE guidelines for this individual set out that \u201cif the individual fulfils the following criteria, risk of heart disease is decreased.\u201d\nNICE Guidelines \u2013 45kg/m2 is typically what a normal weight individual should be achieving for their height with a body mass index higher than 30? Why?\n- 30 kg/m2 indicates ideal risk of heart disease, and\n- 35-39 kg/m2 is generally considered unhealthy\n- If a person meets these criteria, but still meets or exceeds the 20% reduction, 30kg/m2 could be considered healthy. This means that 45kg/m2 can still affect high blood pressure without the risk of high blood pressure.\nWhat are the NICE guidelines for blood lipid and glucose for this hypothetical person meeting an NICE assessment criteria for both condition?\n- Type 2 diabetes management: the patient needs to reduce the cholesterol to below 160 mg/dl and achieve and maintain a fasting blood glucose of: 80 mg/dl and a HbA1C of<5.7% below (<8%)\n- Type 2 diabetes management: the patient is also recommended to reduce the total LDL cholesterol to 150 mg/dl and achieve a fasting blood glucose of: 190 mg/dl and a HbA1C of less than (<74%)\n- Type 2 diabetes management: the patient is also recommended to exercise for at least 30 min/day, and lose no more than 7% body weight if he/she has a BMI of 28kg/m2 and <20 kg/m2.\nSo, we have 5 risk factors in this patient\u2019s profile. 4 risk factors (150-200 mg/dl and below) are achievable by this person using lifestyle modification, and a 45 kg/m2 reduction will still reduce the risk of disease progression.\nNICE guidelines for lifestyle modification have been widely adopted to help people with coronary heart disease, but this person\u2019s BMI is much less than ideal for this specific person when their glucose level in the blood is too high (hyperglycaemia).\nNICE guidelines for lifestyle modification, however, allow for the development of other more manageable risk factors in the patient, such as reduced LDL cholesterol, BMI, weight and glucose. These risk factors are often much easier for people with a BMI of less than 28kg/m2 or in which they are losing weight or exercising more, and may need modifications to their diet.\n- NICE guidance:\n- Type 2 diabetes management: the patient is advised to reduce the total glycaemia to <130mg/dl in 7 consecutive days, and achieve a fasting blood glucose lower than or equal to <70 mg/dl.\n- Lifestyle modification: lifestyle is part of the process of managing risk factors for heart disease.\n- For this person, it would not be appropriate to use lifestyle modification when his/her BMI is less than 28kg/m2.\nNICE guidelines for blood cholesterol need to keep in mind that there are at least two very effective ways to manage high LDL cholesterol levels in these patients:\n- Lifestyle modification: If this person has a family history of heart disease or has a BMI of less than 28kg/m2, and he/she is overweight, lifestyle modification for cholesterol and LDL cholesterol is recommended under \u2018Risk free\u2019 or \u2018Moderate\u2019 status as long he/she does not need to start medication.

The heart health professional should focus on reducing cardiovascular risk by the following three interventions: lifestyle (eating well, reducing salt and fat intake, smoking), medications (antiplatelet drug lowering blood pressure, statins), and blood pressure-lowering medication if lifestyle changes don\u2019t improve disease markers. If lifestyle changes do not reduce blood pressure, antiplatelet drugs, and statins may be recommended.\nThe NICE guideline for CVD risk management and disease prevention is to have annual routine screenings (15-25 years) between the time of a patient\u2019s 50s that includes regular blood pressure screening at the same time.\nAll patients with Framingham Risk 8 are 6.7 above the 95th percentile for age in the United States and should have a cardiovascular risk assessment at every visit. No one should be diagnosed with CVD without assessment.\nI have an 88 year old female, she has no complaints. She is 17 years old at the time of presentation. Dr. Anderson gave the following medication. Last visit 2-days ago for the medication 75 mg / day. She has no symptoms. She is 55 years old at the time she gets her visit. I have done several cardiac tests since last visit. I went to the cardiologist and she informed Dr. Anderson that she has no concerns about my condition. My doctor asked me if I had any recent history to see if that would also be the case. So she sent me to see a cardiologist. He prescribed a new blood pressure control medication for my patient. He gave me a 15 mg mg I.O.D. (20 tablets) every month. She also told me that my condition has changed and I have not had any family members with heart attacks since I was 6. So she told me to ask her how I would like the brand my medication contains. I agreed with her to ask whether it contains b-antinoic acid. So I asked Dr. Anderson. The doctor gave me another test and told me that my blood sugar has increased during the period he gave her medications. He also told me to make sure that she still takes her medications. Also, I asked Dr. Anderson who said nothing except \"Your medication has not changed the blood sugar\" It wasn't stated specifically on the nurse's document that the medication had not been changed. She also stated that her medication increased her blood sugar after taking it. I went to the cardiologist at 51 as a patient, he ordered the blood work and told me that the blood sugar had not changed for my 10 yr old patient. So I have to wonder about the drug that the nurse ordered, and whether she had any history of a previous myocardial infarction. I am so confused.\nThanks for writing to MyCi. The issue is much broader and may involve many details (i.e. medication's or causes, etc.). Although at this point in time I am sure there may be a more effective way, it would help if you could get as much specific information as possible to get an accurate description. Thank you very much.", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him? How should I be prepared to inform others around me? What are the NICE guidelines for the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD)?\nThe best approach to avoid CVD is to do all you can to prevent it. Even if every little bit makes a difference, we can\u2019t do it all. Therefore, there are many, many things you can do to prevent CVD\u2014such as eating a heart-healthy diet, getting regular exercise, taking blood pressure medication, maintaining a healthy weight, reducing the amount of salt and fat in the diet, and reducing blood pressure to below 130/80 mmHg.\nAs we get older, we will need to make some changes in our lifestyles to prevent CVD. The best way to do this is to have an active lifestyle (exercise) and live a healthy lifestyle. So this is my plan:\n- Eat a diet rich in unsaturated fats (vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, and oils)\n- Eat lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, and peas, and low-fat dairy products, nuts, and seeds\n- Do moderate physical activity for at least 150 minutes per week and also to meet the minimum activity level (60 minutes per week, five days a week)\n- Control or prevent high blood pressure by lowering your blood pressure to below 130/80 mmHg. If you have high blood pressure, your first step should be lowering the blood pressure to below 130/80 mmHg. Ask your healthcare provider how to do this when you are younger.\n- Limit your daily intake of sodium, which is high in processed food and canned foods. Foods rich in potassium (potatoes, bananas, and yogurt) may not need to be restricted, but they should still be eaten with caution.\n- Limit your intake of total fat, but only under the supervision of your healthcare provider.\n- Keep it to less than 30% of your total calorie intake, such as 2500 kcal or less in men and 2000 kcal or less in women.\n- Choose healthy fats from fish, nuts, seeds, and oils.\n- Have a regular 7-day schedule for healthy snacking\nThere are other lifestyle changes you can make to reduce your risk of CVD as well:\n- Avoid smoking;\n- Maintaining a healthy weight;\n- Exercising regularly to get a certain amount of daily physical activity;\n- Reducing your intake of salt, such as eating smaller meals more frequently;\n- Limiting your intake of total fat, including saturated fat, cholesterol, trans fat, and free fatty acids;\n- Managing your blood sugar;\n- Taking medications as prescribed\nThe main prevention strategy for CVD involves understanding your risk factors and being able to reduce or control those factors to lower your risk of CVD. You can get the most from your lifestyle with these strategies:\n- Talk to your doctor about your risk of developing CVD;\n- Follow advice you have received on your own from the healthcare team;\n- Take action to limit your intake of fat and sodium in your diet;\n- Avoid a high-fat diet that does not contain enough calories or potassium, a mineral found in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts;\n- Reduce your intake of sodium to less than 2000 mg per day.\n- Limit your intake of total fats to less than 50 g per day or 50% more fat than you burn on a metabolic cycle.\n- Limit your intake of saturated fats to less than 30 g per day or 20 g less than is in a 300 gram meal.\n- Do not consume more than 2oz of red meat per day, or more than 2 small meals per day (6-8hrs each)\n- Do not eat high-cholesterol foods such as red meat, eggs, and butter.\n- Do no drink wine after dinner.\n- Avoid using tobacco and smoking. Ask your doctor if it is OK to smoke when you are having dinner.\n- Limit or avoid alcohol because alcohol has been found to raise the blood pressure of people who have CVD, and it can also affect the way HDL (the good cholesterol) and LDL (the bad cholesterol) work.\n- Limit your intake of caffeine (found in coffee) and other sweetened beverages.\n- Limit your intake of saturated and trans fats (found in meat, bacon\u2019s, and other processed meats).\n- Avoid excessive alcohol.", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\nIf you use these criteria, you would recommend three primary strategies for preventing CVD in this individual: smoking cessation, physical activity, and dietary and weight management. It is also important to keep in mind that all three of these may already be in place as a result of the patient\u2019s history and the individual factors, including medication and comorbidities. You can also tailor the recommendations to the individual, for instance, if John also happens to have diabetes, he may benefit from more exercise and healthy lifestyle choices.\nFor people who have diabetes and no evidence of CVD, you would need to use two strategies for prevention: reducing blood pressure and increasing HDL cholesterol. You would recommend that John\u2019s exercise and diet and lifestyle recommendations change over time. At that point, he would be recommended to start taking medication for hypertension.\nFor individuals with or at high risk of CVD who do not have evidence of CVD, you would have to change the strategy. You would recommend that John modify his diet and physical activity to prevent or manage the cardiovascular and systemic effects of the metabolic disorder, as well as make lifestyle changes to have an healthier blood lipid level.\nThis individual\u2019s blood pressure would need to be lower than expected, or perhaps even lower than 125/80 mmHg. This would also include a reduction or decrease within the following parameters: total cholesterol below 200, HDL cholesterol below 40, blood sugar below 140, blood pressure below 130/80, and total weight below 150.\nYou would also recommend some lifestyle and dietary changes. For instance, you would advise that individuals with type 2 diabetes who do not have evidence of CVD should restrict their carbohydrate intake and consume a low-glycemic index diet. These are diets that are high in complex carbohydrates and healthy fats.\nFor individuals with a higher-than-normal weight and/or body mass index (BMI), you would recommend you change your exercise program and activity level to help manage blood pressure. For some people, these changes to lifestyle and medications will be enough to prevent type 2 diabetes, as well as the progression of the disease. However, you would suggest that someone with a higher-than-average BMI may have better control of their high cholesterol levels and, therefore, also better management of their type 2 diabetes risk.\nYou would recommend you provide your patient with personal and generic education materials, including guidelines on self-care and self-management of their specific condition.\nFor individuals with a risk factor for CVD, you may suggest that them make and adhere to a lifestyle modification plan to prevent or minimize the health consequences of the condition.\nYou would recommend that the patient implement the same strategies for improving their cardiovascular and systemic health as your patient does in the first place.\n- You\u2019ll need to change your patient\u2019s lifestyle \u2014 to prevent or manage CV disease\n- You\u2019ll need to address the individual\u2019s risk factors, including hypertension\n- You\u2019ll need to update the patient\u2019s treatment plan, based on patient feedback\n- You\u2019ll use the patient\u2019s blood lipid level to guide your medication, nutrition, and exercise prescriptions", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\n- The current guidelines are very inadequate \u2013 for a 25 y old Chinese woman whose family history of CVD is consistent with having smoked and has normal blood lipids (1,21) at the appropriate age, she should be advised to take the following statins: atorvastatin, pravastatin, atorvastatin 75 mg once a day, lovastatin or simvastatin 75 mg twice daily and nifedipine 100 mg twice daily. These medications, taken together, help lower both total and LDL-cholesterol (this is the ratio of HDL-cholesterol to total cholesterol) and lower the risks of heart attacks and strokes. Note that statins may increase bone health and increase calcium uptake in the bones compared to placebo/testosterone alone, therefore they are contraindicated for women who have osteoporosis\n- The guideline for the prevention of acute myocardial infarction according to the 10th edition of the Royal College of Physicians is that all patients with a previous heart attack at the age of 50 years or more (any age) should be treated with statins up to 50 times a day without having to stop these medications. This is the ratio of TC to LDL-cholesterol (a factor to consider for patients with type 2 diabetes).\n- The current guideline for cardiovascular events for men with no known cardiovascular disease is the 40-year-old man who is at 100% risk of stroke or another cardiovascular event and who has had a previous stroke due to stroke or coronary artery disease in the past 5 years and those patients should have a one-time, antiplatelet treatment with clofibrate, 300 mg once daily for the first two hours of the first dose; then with the same dose every day for the next two hours until the first dose is given again, once a week for the remaining 20 weeks.\n- In addition, a patient with diabetes who starts therapy should get an accurate lipid profile that includes total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, total protein and the specific measurement of triglycerides.\n- Other treatment should be instituted for those at low risk as long as evidence demonstrates the benefits.\n- For CVD, the current guidelines suggest reducing total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels from the upper third of the heart to the upper third of the heart.\n- Total cholesterol should be decreased by 10-15 mmol/L.\n- Lower triglyceride levels should be increased from 15.6 mg/dL or elevated levels should be treated with a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol:HDL ratio of <60 mg/dL.\n- A 30 kg man who is at 50% risk of heart failure with a history of coronary artery disease should take a statin with a T4-free formulation on a daily basis for at least 6 months, and stop taking it if he is experiencing any of these cardiovascular events: angina, heart attack, or stroke, or any complication of the treatment.\n- For patients with diabetes - the risk of developing diabetes complications should be limited to 5% (10,12, 13, 14, 15) with 5% of the population living with diabetes, so those with diabetes should take an antihyperglycemic agent. Diabetes has another important risk factor \u2013 a person with diabetes should avoid smoking and excessive alcohol use, since excessive alcohol has been found to produce a decline in HDL cholesterol.\n- Screening of all non-smokers for diabetes should be established, if an increase in triglycerides is found, treatment of this risk factor would be initiated, with low dose lovastatin and simvastatin.\n- Currently the available studies on cholesterol screening in women should include women above 35 yrs who are not otherwise at risk for cardiovascular disease. In addition to the following screening guidelines for lipid profile and BMI, the guidelines also state all women who meet these criteria for regular physical activity and no known risk factor or cardiovascular disease should get tested every 2 or 3 years if not diagnosed as prediabetic or pre-diabetic, or are at risk.\n- In patients with diabetes a recent increase in triglycerides of 3 or more mmol/L (the upper end of the range in this case) could be indicative of coronary artery disease, so it is imperative that triglycerides be monitored with an antihyperlipid", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him? Find out in question \"The role of genetics in CVD as well as age in the overall burden and risk\".\nWhat is the risk for CVD? Are the risk factors similar in that age? You take the NICE guidelines and find out the answers.\nIn a different article, a Chinese researcher says, \"Age is actually one of the major factors in the incidence of diabetes, which is an important risk factor of CVDs both in our society and our children\". This is very close to my current research interest.\nDo the NICE guidelines for CVD, age, and other risk factors have that one big risk factors?. If so, is there a way to find out it at a population level?\nAnother question: is the risk of CVD in a region higher according to the 2018 634.000 census? Also, the question: how many people in the population are being affected by CVD?\nThe answer is: the percentage of all people who have been identified as having a condition, and this percentage will be much better if we put the number of years since the birth of the subject in relation to the life expectancy of a population. Here are the numbers:\nAge at conception is 2.5 years, birth and life expectancy is 41.2 years. It seems that by age 50 years, the mortality rate of 0.2 % in China is twice the mortality rate in the UK per year. The life expectancy decreases by 4.1 years (16 years per year) to 60 years; it is 10 years shorter than England (20 years per year) and Wales (14 years in this region); Japan has a higher life expectancy than any other nation.\nIf mortality rate of the whole population is 2.5 and a person has life expectancy of 41.2 years, mortality rate of 0.2 % should be similar to that in China. I just found the following answer to another question: \"The question: what are the common risks factors among China's population? \"\n\"What are those common risks factors among China's population and how are those risks factors compared with those in the general population of the UK, the UK and the China?\nI should mention the following:\nFirst of all, there is still a large number of people who do not know that their life is at least 70 years old, in terms of age and genetics. It should also be added that most of these people do not know whether their grandparents and great grandparents, which are now living to be 65 years old, if they had children of this age. This is a real problem in Europe and the USA and the UK as well as here in China.\nAnd because we have a really large number of people who know that their grandparents and great-grandparents, we can make a table: 70 years. This is a big number, where we want our population to be 80%, but the number of people who know that they have grandparents and great-grandparents is very small. There is a larger amount of people with grandparents that is not able to remember themselves, especially women, and then there are a lot of children that are unable to remember themselves.\nIt is also important to note that we have a very small number of people who do not know that they have grandparents, which makes the data from the table somewhat less accurate.\nIn the table above, people who have a grandmother and grandfather as their grandparents, will see an average \"120 years\" of life for that grandmother and grandfather, although for all grandparents, there is no record. This may make it seem as if it is still 41.2 years, but it is not, so in principle, it will be 80 years.\nFor example, China has a small population. The number of people is 48.5 million; for all grandparents of China, there are a total of 27.8 million people, which is 45.2% lower than the figure of 80.1 million. There are only 265,000 people; they have 208,000 grandchildren and great-grandchildren, which is a huge difference in population figures. There are about 80 people by 70 years age, which is quite high.\nWhat are the risks factors related to CVD risk in China?\nThe key questions: why not there seems to be some common risks factors among all people", "Given that John is a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, currently smokes, does not have diabetes, and has a family history of CVD, what are the NICE guidelines for CVD prevention for him?\nThe current high-fibre dietary recommendations for women of childbearing years can be incorporated with the dietary recommendations from the NICE guideline. Based on the 2013 Indian diet, a 50% reduction in the consumption of added fats and refined sugar should be considered. Carbohydrate-low-glycaemic index diets are recommended for women of childbearing age. FIB-low-glycaemic index-low carb diets will provide benefits by reducing the postprandial sugar absorption, which may lead to weight loss, improved fasting sugar and postprandial glycaemia, improved glycaemic control and decreased cardiovascular risk [2,3,4]. A 2008 meta-analysis of randomised trials in adults with type 2 diabetes found that a healthy diet, although not entirely high-fibre, could be an optimal dietary intake for managing the disease; however, this may require the use of both fibre and carbohydrates [5,6].\n3. Smoking and diabetes\nThe risk of diabetes doubles for every 20 cigarettes smoked per day. In this study, 111 African adults with severe overweight were randomised to either a cigarette-free lifestyle or lifelong smoking cessation (lifetime smokers who completed the questionnaire were eligible) for two months, and all were offered no type 2 diabetes (including oral medications and insulin) and offered all type 2 diabetes (including oral medications and insulin), as well as diabetes control and prevention programs (both intervention and control). The smokers who were offered all types of diabetes were those who were at risk of type 2 diabetes (such as age over 45, a family history of type 2, type 1 diabetes, certain sex, non-white individuals).\nThe smokers reported a smoking history well over 10 years (at least one former smoker), while the nondiabetics reported no use of smoking and no smoking history (mean age: 37.5 years and the current smoking prevalence was 28.7%). They were given a questionnaire to assess any disease in the family for 19\u201330 years, but had no history of hypertension or dyslipidaemia. They were offered the smoking-free lifestyle and were told they could use any type of diabetes control program they wanted via the intervention group. The smokers were offered 2\u20136 doses of a long acting oral hypoglyidemic agent, with the number that was administered having no or lesser influence on glycaemic outcomes compared with the dose administered by the intervention group alone. (The efficacy of the long acting agent in the control group was estimated to have been a factor of 2.6\u20134.9 for the average 2\u20136 dose administered by the intervention participants and 3.04\u20135.10 for the intervention with the placebo (n=240). No further information is available on the number of dose administered by the intervention participants as this is expected to be more consistent among all of the participants in each intervention group than was the first one to receive the intervention).\nThe participants were asked about whether they smoked in the past 12 months, although none was specifically asked if the smokers had stopped smoking and if they were aware of no known chronic disease, hypertension, dyslipidaemia or diabetes. Although they were asked if they had ever been diagnosed with CVD within the past 12 months, they were asked whether they had ever smoked a tobacco product. They were instructed not to report their smoking dates.\n3.1.1 BMI and waist circumference\nThe participants were asked about their BMI, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI) and pulse oximetry, as well as whether they were overweight or not. A 5-fold increase in BMI and waist circumference in the last 5 years were associated with the increase in type 2 diabetes and hypertension. A second-degree relative to non-smoking in both the current and long lasting smoking control groups was considered overweight. All participants were interviewed at baseline using a questionnaire including age, gender, smoking history, current BMI (BMI \u226530 kg/m2) and pulse oximetry.\n3.2 Diet and physical activity\nThe participants were asked about their dietary intake, with an emphasis on frequency, calorie intake and vegetable consumption, and was designed to include a discussion of whether the participants were in a normal or unhealthy eating pattern. Although some items were limited to 5%, eating was measured on a scale from highest to lowest according to nutrient content, and total energy was measured relative to the energy intake of the last 5 years. A total"], "3": ["Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\nPlease let an academic refer you to Professor Zhang, a professor in cardiovascular medicine at the Beijing Medical College of University of Chinese Medicine:\nDr Zhang (firstname.lastname@example.org), \"The heart's main task during physical activity during the day is to preserve energy, transport oxygen, and supply nutrients to all the active cell components of the whole body. However, in the evening, at the level of the blood. It is of important importance not to have blood circulating in the body for many hours while exercising. We can't make it clear that we should exercise during the night in order to have more than enough energy during the day.\"\nIn addition to the information provided by Professor Zhang, John's blood-pressure is higher than 130/80 (P = 0.015), while the fasting blood-glucose is 166/100 (P = 0.052). John's cholesterol levels are 260 (P = 0.011). The BMI is 22.39 kg/m2 (P = 0.010). He says, you will have to make a hard decision whether or not to have the exercise at night.\n\"At night, the body has two functions: to warm its core, and to protect the heart and lungs from damage caused by exercise at low temperatures. I should never have done that, because in that kind of way, it is not appropriate,\" says John.\nThe National Health and Medical Records, and the Chinese population registry, state that, in November 2016, the rate per capita of premature deaths was 77 per 100,000 inhabitants. 45.7 years. The WHO estimates that 4 million people die of CVD in China every year. The death rate has fallen since 2012. Now the death rate is much higher this year. The \"average daily calorie intake of 2010 was 2,300 kcal. A year ago, about seven times more calories were consumed than expected. According to statistics, when people are overweight or underweight, it causes more deaths than excessive caloric consumption, not enough calories are supplied to the body (energy balance),\" stresses John. The elderly should not do more physical activity than normal.\nWhen John was 53 years of age in 2009, he weighed 92 kg. His body weight (weight in kilograms) decreased by 3.5 kg. John's body mass index was 0.65 (P = 0.034) compared with the age reference: 19.6 in 2000. During the next 10 years at the age of 77 years, the weight of his body decreased (BMI = 0.75 to 0.76 in 2015), but his waist size decreased (weight in kg increased from 109 kg to 110; P = 0.078). During the year, his BMI is 1.6 (P = 0.166).\n- The Chinese Government has been looking at the \"dietary regime for healthy living\" at the same time as other national and international medical societies, but there are no concrete scientific guidelines for it, and there is no clear method by which nutrition for healthy living is being properly assessed. According to the guidelines, food should be eaten in moderation and balanced, as it increases the calorie intake, but in moderation, in addition to diet and physical activity, it is also a good idea to drink enough fluids and avoid smoking and alcohol.\nHow many grams of fat and calories of protein are needed in healthy living, according to the Chinese Dietary Guidelines.\n- The \"dietary regime for healthy living\" in China has been looking at the advice to \"consume a balanced diet for healthy living, including a moderate and constant intake of the following foods: fat, protein and carbohydrates. \"\nFat, protein and carbohydrates are the major food categories, as the diet guideline mentions, and the more fatty foods and high-calorie foods are taken into account, the larger are their calories.\nThe guidelines on food and health states: \"In order to avoid premature deaths and serious chronic diseases, it is essential to eat the correct balance of proteins and fats of 20 to 30 percent from fat, 40 to 60 percent from protein, and 50 to", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\nQ: Are there other factors that may explain some of John's findings?\nThe NICE guidelines recommend that individuals aged 55-70 years should be screened regularly for coronary heart disease. Cardiovascular diseases account for around 50% of all deaths in this age bracket. In addition, there are increased risk factors for CVD in over 50s:\n- High blood pressure\n- Cardiovascular risk factors\n- Smoking (low-density lipoprotein), alcohol drinking and physical inactivity\nWhat is the latest evidence showing that exercise improves blood pressure?\nA study led by Dr A. S. N. S. Thippasan et al. from the University of Auckland in New Zealand found that people who walk at least 15km a week or 15 hour sessions had lower blood pressure readings than inactive individuals who exercised. These data suggest exercise may be associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease in older adults (25).\nWhat recommendations can be made to John for exercise?\nJohn could be sedentary - he walks regularly, gets around, and walks his dog, which reduces potential muscle soreness for him. He would likely be overweight and have a high waistline as measured by A-G measurements (your waistline gives you a good sense of if you have a BMI of 30 or more). However, he may be a healthy weight because weight is just a number, and we don't necessarily need to be weighing ourselves to be in an appropriate weight range for himself. The majority of the time exercise burns a large proportion of the energy we need. In other words, regular exercise helps you burn energy, even if you are overweight - exercise even though it might cost you more to be healthy!\nAlthough exercise is important for muscle health, it can also help the body cope with ageing and disease. In this case, exercise can offer help with maintaining muscle strength and stamina as we get older.\nWhat would you advise John to do to help keep himself healthy?\nIt may be helpful for Johnny to maintain a healthy weight. Losing more than 5-8% of his body weight may assist him in getting some amount of health for the rest of his life.\nJohn would do well to continue vigorous physical activity for his health - doing 20-25 minutes per workout each day. Exercise will increase cardiovascular health and help us to exercise more easily and find more ways to exercise safely.\nQ: What are the recommended amounts of exercise for young people?\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services recommends four daily hours of vigorous physical activity for both men and women aged 18-65. This advice was based on a 150-minute daily aerobic challenge, with 30 minutes an hour of moderate physical activity and 30 minutes at a minimum of 2 hours of vigorous activity. The NICE guidelines suggest that physical activity is more important for people with Type 2 Diabetes, or at risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes, and for older people.\nQ: How much movement do physical activities involve?\nIn an active person, this translates to activities that involve a large number of body movements and are continuous. For exercise, the same move is done many times. For example, doing exercises at the gym or sports centre but doing them in your walking area would most likely be the definition of non-activity.\nFor exercise, the same moves are used to do a variety of physical activities, but each move would have little impact on one another. For example, you might be doing a set of tai chi moves (running, jumping, etc.), but a push and pull at the same time will need more movement. For activities such as gardening, lifting heavy objects or cleaning, more movement may be needed, but this is much more intense.\nQ: How much is too much?\nThe goal of exercising is to do 30-60 minutes a day to move your body. If it is an activity you enjoy, this will be enough. However, if it does not, or if only a tiny amount of activity is needed, we recommend that exercise is included into activities you enjoy - not necessarily something as intense as a running race.\nQ: What would other people say?\nIf your life is affected, it can be hard to understand exactly how you feel, because the words are hard to put into words. However, it can be helpful to know that the same words are used to describe your experiences and feelings. It makes you feel like someone is reading your mind, so the first time you exercise might be a difficult experience.", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?

The first target is to have a normal HbA(2) level of less than 6.7 mmol/L (serum HbA(2)) for all the blood pressure readings during a certain period of time. This is measured on the home blood pressure monitor and can be obtained from your doctor\u2019s office or at a convenient point in time. To decrease your blood pressure, your doctor will advise you to consume less-than-restricted, sugar-rich foods.\nIf symptoms are mild and do not interfere with normal activities, treatment can usually be avoided.

The findings revealed that this study shows that there is a strong relationship between CVD risk factors and the severity of the CVD. These results indicate the significant role of CVD in the prevention and control of hypertension and diabetes and the importance of focusing on these risk factors.\nIn order to mitigate these risks, the researchers suggest that a focus should be placed on lowering blood pressure even though only 5-10% of people with high blood pressure will need treatment. Other recommendations recommended to all patients with hypertension include control of family history of hypertension and taking aspirin before going to the doctor to check cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Finally, to reduce the risk for diabetes and heart disease, patients should maintain a healthy blood sugar level and follow good control of their diabetes and blood pressure.\nIf you want to learn more about cardiovascular risk factors and CVD prevention, please refer to this article.\n12 thoughts on \u201cHow to Lower Blood Pressure and Reduce Your Risk of Coronary Heart Disease\u201d\nLots of information, but I also have heart disease, was a smoker, not diagnosed and not at the high risk for CVD.\nThank you for sharing this blog!\nI feel this is important as it might lead to change in your approach to diet, nutrition and lifestyle.\nIt\u2019s about awareness.

Thanks so generously for sharing about risk for CVD.\nIt\u2019s well, but it\u2019s not something that you\u2019d discuss.\nThanks for sharing. I have been trying to develop an effort to reduce my blood pressure and is doing pretty well, at this stage\u2026 but it\u2019s really important to know that the benefits (risk of my CVD are so small at present) of a diet low in saturated fats and trans fats can be significant for me.\nIt is very important to be aware of this, and even the idea that if I were to have a heart attack while eating a low-fat diet, or I eat a high-fat diet, I would be putting myself at risk that my risk of these diseases would be more than me.\nI see this way here.\nThanks for sharing. It does sound like some of what you have tried to do. I\u2019d appreciate someone to look at my situation, what strategies or products might work well for me or what would you consider to be a good diet of living a heart healthy lifestyle.\nThank you for this advice.

We would have recommended this would be all that needs to be done, not just 6 weeks of diet, and 3 months of exercise as that is the 1 day we just have to do. But, just how do you calculate which will be the best cardiovascular guideline for me?\nQ. What is the optimal cardio duration for you?\nA (1) I understand your question. You need to focus not on your heart rate, you need to focus on the following 3 parameters that can help determine your fitness level: the pulse rate, your resting heart rate and your cardio metabolic activity. For John, we would have calculated his resting heart rate at: 85/min (your resting heart rate that is determined using an electrocardiogram test) after 3 weeks of running. It would be 74/min or as a general rule of thumb, if you\u2019re more fitter, you can increase your pulse rate and workout regime may need to go up a bit.\nHowever, his resting heart rate was only 61/min, it means he needs to get back more into his exercising regime \u2013 he\u2019d probably go up 30 min to 60 min.\nHowever, John needs to be more fit, so if his height, weight and blood pressure are the same as John, he must increase his exercise regime. So, he has to be more fit than John.\nIf John had to be more fit than you, how does that affect his fitness (which will be discussed later in the day), and more importantly, how will your recommendations change at what age and at what level of fitness (your cardio metabolic activity), in terms of your exercise regime?\nQ. What are some guidelines for exercise for seniors?\nA. In terms of exercise guidelines, we are in favour of aerobic exercise (running, walking) for seniors \u2013 that is, if you can, increase it to at least 3 days per week, then you can continue to do moderate aerobic exercise if that is the focus of your exercise regimen.\nOn the other one hand, aerobic exercise will help reduce cholesterol in your system and keep it low, but not in every case. In older people, 30-minute walking or cycling should be the basis of your exercise routine.\nQ. What about weight reduction?\nA. You\u2019re probably not surprised by this, and what I understand is this one: when you have 20 pounds in your body, when you have 80, I would argue if not more, your cardio metabolic capacity is lower than the average and your exercise would be reduced accordingly. We have an ideal body frame, for example, we have to be tall, but not too tall, if our body is already thin, we\u2019ll have an exercise plan and this has to be targeted for the age. I don\u2019t think this is that very important to keep in mind when you talk to us.\nQ. When you are over the age of 80, what sort of medical issues can I worry about?\nA. What does I mean by medical issues? I mean we know that most of you are above a certain age. You\u2019re a young person, maybe around 55, you have an increased risk factor for cardiovascular disease after 55, you may be at a higher risk factor for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease after 70. So, your risk is higher for many types than we have, but there are many other factors that should be kept in mind.\nQ. What are the benefits compared to traditional cardio regime?\nA. The main benefit of standard aerobic exercise is that you improve cardiovascular fitness. This increases HDL cholesterol and reduced your bad cholesterol.\nIn the case of your John, John\u2019s cardio metabolic activity \u2013 is all about the rest of his day, the 40 minutes to 60 minutes for the exercise regime.\nIf his cardiovascular fitness is at an optimal level or high, that is, he\u2019s at a healthy weight without any type of illness \u2013 he doesn\u2019t need to work out if it\u2019s not improving and his cardiovascular fitness will improve from then on (or he\u2019ll have to work out).\nQ. How do you calculate your exercise goals for your body type?\nA. If you\u2019re in an exercise regime of 3 to 4 days per week for someone in a flat-pack style, a person with a mid range height, waist and hip circumference could have a 65-meter treadmill run of 6.5 or", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\nThe heart patient can achieve the following goals with the aim of improving and/or maintaining the body's capacity to pump fluid in and out of the lungs and peripheral circulation and restoring and maintaining control of blood pressure, blood glucose levels and cholesterol levels and weight. The following recommendations can be made for John:\nLifestyle changes for John (pre-exacerbation)\nIf John is at risk for heart problems or heart disease that may be exacerbated by non-cardiac illness, John can be encouraged to quit smoking and do regular exercise. Most importantly, regular exercise has been proven to be a potent way to support heart health, as described in several scientific literature. John can also undergo one week of intensive cardiac rehabilitation, through which lifestyle changes, nutritional modifications, exercise and education will help John to maintain a healthy and strong cardiovascular system.\nLifestyle, drug and surgical choices for John depend on the stage of his condition and the severity of all his conditions. These medications are based on evidence of effectiveness, patient preferences and benefits as described in the NICE guidelines.\nAll patients with symptoms should consult a specialist at least within 100 kilometers of the location where they currently spend most of their time, such as a place of work, and the local pharmacist. This is considered the most appropriate location, as it has been found that medications should be used only for treatment of primary illness if appropriate.\nSurgical options can be very effective in supporting John's cardiovascular system following heart surgery. During the first hospital stay, John can undergo a general anesthetic, then a local anesthetic with local steroid injection (for the surgical process), and an epidural infusion (for the recovery period after the operation). A complete blood count test can be done to check the effectiveness of all medications used.\nIn addition, surgery can be used to reduce stress on the heart, such as placing a clip on the chest, which temporarily increases stress level, or placing a heart pacemaker, with help of a surgical probe.\nHeart transplant has been recommended to John for all individuals with congestive heart failure. In order to accept such treatment, John must be at least 55 years, and he is likely to die before the age of 70 years or as much as 85 years, whichever comes first.\nJohn can be admitted to a cardiac care unit, where he may then be maintained on a continuous drip of blood products to prevent blood clots forming and to regulate the balance of fluid in the blood, thus keeping the heart working properly. This is sometimes referred to as the \"heART\", which stands for Home Cardio Therapy.\nThe patient is in the cardiac center under non-specialist care and is allowed to return to his routine activities, e.g. at home. However, John's health status at that point will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit, especially if John starts using non-cardiac medications.\nHeart transplant and cardiac care units should not be confused with cardiac ICU wards, which are used to isolate and monitor patients with acute heart failure, even if they are admitted in cardiac care units. This is because the transplant unit typically serves as a temporary place in which heart failure can be treated without being monitored.\nHeart transplantation was the only alternative or cure for many types of heart conditions, but it was not feasible in order to prevent the progression of heart failure to end-stage heart failure, due to the shortage of organs. The heart transplant process required 2 patients or 6 months. The surgery cost is very high; in many countries, the initial expenses are around 20,000 dollars.\nA transplant is the best option to restore your heart and lungs. Coronary artery surgery is the mainstay therapy for many heart muscle diseases. Coronary artery bypass grafting or angioplasty can also reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications due to abnormal blood vessel growth that occurs during surgery. If your condition has deteriorated to cardiac heart failure, there is currently a new strategy that uses a special cardiac drug called sotalol.\nSotalol can be given to the heart and lungs in the presence of fluid buildup, thus reversing the damage from the heart failure and the subsequent heart muscle damage and strengthening the supply of blood to the heart muscles, which helps in the treatment of heart failure. This new strategy was approved by the UK regulator on 7 February 2018.\nThe effectiveness of sotalol has been verified in many patients with heart failure. The clinical results have been very encouraging, with patients receiving 70% of the treatment regimen they've needed. There are very few side", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\nYour expert\u2019s guidance on lifestyle guidelines for people like John can help prevent or reduce his risk of heart disease and the risk of sudden cardiac arrest. This includes limiting and avoiding:\n- Tobacco (smoking or drinking) and alcohol\n- Caffeinated and carbonated drinks\n- Excess weight (carrying extra weight)\n- Alcohol and binge drinking\n- Certain medications (e.g.: sleeping pills, benzodiazepines); taking certain blood pressure lowering agents (e.g. ACE drugs\nA patient needs to understand their own cardiovascular risk profile from a health professional and a patient\u2019s risk factor and lifestyle, he should be able to advise themselves of the best measures of personal risk and the reasons for the need to make healthy lifestyle changes\nThe primary goal for cardiovascular treatment in John, with any cardiovascular risk factors, is to reduce the risk of heart disease, or to reduce the symptoms due to the disease in both the heart and the blood vessels. This usually means controlling blood pressure, reducing cholesterol and reducing your risk of heart attack and heart disease altogether by eating a healthy and limited and nutritious diet. In most cases, the NHS guidelines suggest following a healthy diet and exercise routine.\nAt present, there is no \u2018cure\u2019 for coronary artery disease, but there are a number of treatments that can help. These treatments can be divided into two main types: drug treatment and surgical treatment. These treatments can be recommended individually or in combination, and are referred to as either \u2018surgical\u2019 or \u2018drug treatment\u2019.\nDrug treatments work on the basis of increasing the heart\u2019s pumping capacity. To do this, patients need to cut down on their saturated fat (for example, bacon, red meat, and baked goods), reduce their intake of trans-fats, and increase their intake of healthy unsaturated fats (for example, olive and canola oils, and oily fish, especially fish with edible eyes).\nSmoking cessation is another important factor in reducing the risk of heart disease and the risk of cardiovascular events. If you can stop smoking, other treatments offered through the NHS are available in the form of medications, e-cigarettes and herbal or dietary supplements.\nThere is no known definitive test for coronary artery disease (CAD), but the most effective tests are those available as a test for other heart conditions. This is available in most hospitals to help with the assessment and management of cardiac conditions.\nMost patients with coronary artery disease either have not previously had a diagnosis of an initial heart disease, or have taken medicine containing cholesterol-lowering drugs which are able to lower blood cholesterol. They are often referred to a specialist cardiology practice for management of their underlying heart disease. In some cases referral is appropriate.\nThe most important treatment strategy for coronary artery disease or angina is drugs to treat high blood pressure (see section on the \u2018high blood pressure\u2019 above). This treatment is generally given as \u2018clots inhibitors\u2019 or thiazide diuretics which reduces the levels of sodium (salt) in the blood, so that blood pressure can be brought down. Other drugs in the treatment are called aspirin and other antiplatelet drugs (such as warfarin). These medications should only be used for the initial treatment of mild coronary heart disease, or for the treatment of acute symptoms in patients with coronary artery disease.", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD? This is a very difficult question!\nThe first thing to say is that, based on the advice he has already received \u2014 through the NHS \u2014 John\u2019s blood pressure and cholesterol may be quite appropriate. However, our advice is that he should also be examined at least every year using the guidelines. A routine ECG and complete blood count can also provide useful baseline data to help determine your individual individual baseline risk and determine the need for further tests such as statins and fibrates and cholesterol lowering drugs or the need for more frequent testing.\nSo what is the best exercise plan to lose blood pressure?\nExercise can help to improve your body composition, lower blood pressure and help to improve your heart health, so it is essential you aim to get your step count on target and if you are currently doing no more than half an hour of moderate exercise five times weekly, you may be able to fall back into that category. Of course, the only evidence we can provide here is for how to meet a specific objective, that\u2019s what you should be asking yourself, but there are a number of key evidence-based recommendations that help us all achieve our best at reducing our risk of cardiovascular diseases, which include:\n- Reduce the total weight of the body to reduce excess fat and/or increase \u2018good\u2019 soluble fibre intake\n- Reduce the amount of salt, sugar, fat and cholesterol you consume, if you don\u2019t have any of the recommended daily food servings, and ensure you get 5 portions of fruit and veggies\n- Stop smoking (if you are not a smoker).\n- Maintain a healthy weight as you will have a greater chance of having a healthy heart\n- Reduce how frequently the blood pressure is measured so you can reduce your blood pressure if you are having any type of heart problem\n- Get a full fitness-training session 6\u20138 weeks before the cardiac examination, which will help you to have a greater chance of meeting your clinical criteria\n- Get an appointment to start a medical team consultation, which will help you to find a suitable program that will address your needs. Our recommendations can also be modified as appropriate to your needs.\nWhat are the recommendations above?\nThere is now considerable evidence linking stress levels to health problems both in the short- and long-term, such as anxiety, high blood pressure, mood disorders, depression, heart disease, poor sleep pattern and so on. A high stress life could be a key factor in the development of heart disease in future. With the increase in stress we live in, there is a real need to be able to monitor our stress levels and see how we need to change our lifestyles to reduce stress levels. This is not easy, because everyone\u2019s life is affected by stress, including the way we exercise, our diet, our physical appearance and so on. We may not have as much time at Handbags and Sippies, where we feel we are less likely to fall back to our old self, and less likely to feel anxious, but we are still likely to get stressed when working out, with the stress of our own personal commitments and family obligations and so on.\nSo how can we relax and manage our stress levels to improve our cardiovascular health?\nYou can start to achieve a very good physical and mental health, which will have a good impact on your overall wellbeing and allow you to reduce your potential risk of future cardiovascular diseases. It\u2019s all about managing your workload and increasing your physical activity, and making sure you are well-nourished, which will lead to better health, better quality sleep and so on. This is an ongoing process and I would encourage anyone who has achieved long-lasting success in dealing with their stress to also do the exercise they did that day and plan a walk each day. It\u2019s good for you, it\u2019s good for your health, and you\u2019ll feel great later, too!\nSo what is so bad about sitting or watching TV so late in the evening? Well, I think it\u2019s a pretty big issue, particularly for your children! Many studies indicate that parents spend less time in bed than they do when they go to sleep. It has been shown that when children are encouraged to be active during bedtime, they have improved lung function and lower blood pressure. Sitting or lying down while watching TV or listening to music has been shown to lead to high blood pressure levels, whereas being sedentary at home, in a classroom, on your iPad, on your tablet, or glued to another phone or tablet is the opposite. The good news is that you don\u2019t have to do sitting or watching TV too much", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\n- 2.

What are the optimal steps for reducing total cholesterol and improving HDL levels if John is obese?\n- 5. What is the optimal steps for both weight and blood pressure for improving the cardiac return?\nHow much can heart failure cause?\nNo one can say exactly how much, but in most patients with congestive heart failure the risk of death is 2-4 times greater than the risk of death from coronary heart disease in both healthy subjects and in patients with congestive heart failure. Heart failure occurs in all ages, but is one of the more common causes of death in elderly people and in patients who undergo heart surgery. The risk of death in elderly people with congestive heart failure increases by 31%.\nHow many people have died because of heart failure?\nAbout 2-3 million people die each year as a result of heart failure and this figure is expected to increase as more and more people become afflicted by the disease.\nWho is likely to develop heart failure and what are the risks?\nAnyone who has a heart transplant, an artificial heart or a ventricular septal defect is at risk. People who suffer from diabetes, obesity or who have had heart surgery are also at risk of heart failure and their condition is more likely to become worse.\nWhen will heart failure begin to develop?\nThe frequency of heart failure and the progression of symptoms varies from person to person. Some people can be affected every day, and others in 3-5 years. It may be that there is only gradual development and may not present any symptoms for many years before the diagnosis of heart failure has been made.\nWhat are the symptoms of heart failure?\nSymptoms of heart failure occur gradually over many years and may include shortness of breath, loss of appetite, fatigue, swollen ankles or legs, fever, weight loss or weight gain, swelling under the skin or in the neck, ears, throat and stomach, and shortness of breath or a heavy cough.\nWhat do doctors think of people with heart failure and what is the risk of heart failure developing in them?\nThere is no cure for the condition but it is a serious issue. Heart failure can be mild or severe. Mild heart failure means that the patient is having symptoms but the treatment is not good. Sustained symptoms mean that the patient is not getting well. Severe heart failure means that the patient is having symptoms constantly from time to time. This can lead to sudden death if they do not know what to do to treat the problem. In these cases, it is important that it is treated by a specialist such as a cardiologist or pulmonologist.", "Using the NICE guidelines, what cardiovascular recommendations can be made for John, a 70-year-old, Chinese, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, non-diabetic and with a family history of CVD?\nJuan C.

As a part of this, patients are allowed to eat only small amounts of alcohol.\n- The patient is placed in a heart rate monitoring device.\n- The patient is introduced to the appropriate lifestyle approach, a 3-minute walk each day for two weeks.\n- The patient is sent to a cardiac catheterisation suite.\n- The patient has an exercise session every day with the help of the catheterisation suite therapist.\nThe patient is released after a 30-day period for a medical evaluation.\nThe patient is discharged from hospital to a rehabilitation centre where we will help him to regain his cardiovascular fitness, which the patient has improved by the 30 days.

With the help of the therapist, his physiotherapist or cardiologist in a short period, we will teach him how to go from within and to outside the cardiology unit.\nIn most cases it is not necessary to start these activities during the 30 days and the results will occur only after one year of treatment. In those patients with coronary heart disease during an acute attack, these therapies continue to be very important for the patient until he stabilises sufficiently.

We would use the guidelines available in the NICE website for a few months and hopefully help someone in the future.\nJohn is a 34 year old male who, after a high school diploma, now has a history of obesity and smoking. He came in for a visit to his cardiologist where we decided that John has not been receiving the very best cardiovascular treatment so far. In addition, John has already suffered a heart attack, heart failure, angina pectoris, and has suffered two strokes.\nJohn's medical history is in contradiction to his overall health. He has two large abdominal aortic aneurysms, four chronic kidney diseases and is taking many medications.\nWe can use NICE guidelines to determine the cause of these comorbidities, as well as the exact cause of John's cardiovascular disease. This will allow us to tailor our recommendations based on the patient's risk factors, and develop an initial treatment plan.\nThis particular patient has two large amyoplasia aneurysms, each of which are at least a 3 cm in diameter.

Also, we know that John has not been receiving any medications for heart failure, cancer, or chronic kidney disease (CKD) despite having these medical conditions.\nBecause this patient is at the very high risk for heart disease, he is currently receiving a combination of medications to manage chronic kidney disease and CKD. Currently, the patient is on three antihypertensive medications, one statin (Alvera) and one oral loop glucose monitoring(LFBG), plus at least 30 hours of oral medication alone.\nJohn's primary concern is not that he is in cardiac arrest, or not yet at risk for any cardiac event, as this patient would be a candidate for cardiac bypass surgery (SCD or open heart surgery) early in life. He would have had such an event in the past, and was just too young to have the type of surgery.\nThis patient is already a candidate for coronary artery bypass surgery, so we are not ready to put him on therapy for CVD. John was not eligible for therapy with medication for CKD and CKD medications because his family and his pediatrician disagreed about the importance of following prescription dosing after diabetes.\nIf you would like to request a personalized discussion with an NICE consultant we offer you the opportunity to receive information on cardiac screening and management (with our expertise in cardiology and cardiovascular disease referral).\nFor those who would like to see an NICE consultant, please select the box to the right of each of the numbers in our database menu.\nTo take our evaluation, you will need to provide information about your diagnosis and any other relevant information.

It\u2019s a rare incident of a stroke that happened in a child whose mother has been giving medication and blood transfusions to his young nieces and nephews to prevent him from developing cerebral palsy and the kind of neurological damage that leads some to die. The baby, who is at the time 43, died soon after he was in the hospital hours after receiving his second injection of medicine for high blood pressure. He was first diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of three, and has since spent days in hospital. His mother, a nurse by training, had been diagnosed with acute cerebral palsy but took the baby to China\u2019s Shanghai Hospital in late November. That child, 38, needed a second stroke 22 days after delivering her second child last year. The man was 43 when his mother gave him the injection. He had no medical help in China, though, so the hospital\u2019s nursing staff gave him transfusions of blood and intravenous medicines. Now he\u2019s in the same hospital \u2013 and has to take extra medicines. The woman\u2019s husband, 51, has another stroke, too, and she\u2019s also in China\u2019s Shanghai Hospital:\nI was very worried because my husband is getting a second stroke in Singapore, in the next 24 hours. On Tuesday, I was 6 weeks old and I started the second infusion. I heard about the stroke. What happened next was unexpected.\n\u201cI was 6 weeks old and had a high blood pressure,\u201d said John. \u201cNow I\u2019m on a wheelchair and I have a very stiff neck, a very weak arm and the muscles are not walking properly anymore.\u201d His wife says he was at the hospital with a friend after the stroke that morning. But John\u2019s wife is skeptical. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long these things stay with him,\u201d she said.\nThe girl, who is 40, had been living with cerebral palsy for 15 years and had suffered multiple strokes, heart attacks and spinal injuries. Her daughter had taken 13 trips to China last year and now he gets multiple strokes.\nMany people in Asia are not even born in China, so what is going on in the brain that causes stroke? This is called stroke, the leading cause of death in Asia, according to the World Health Organization. Stroke in kids can begin with a fever and an upset stomach, and then a stroke can be caused by high blood pressure and a blood clot obstructing a major artery leading into the brain \u2013 for example, a \u201ccarotid artery plaque attack\u201d \u2013 then by a blood clot blocking an artery to the left side of the brain and causing a \u201csynovial stroke\u201d between the front and the back of the brain.\nThe stroke was diagnosed recently in a 34-year-old man in Beijing named Lengshang, who got a diagnosis two months ago from his neurologist at the Beijing Vascular Research Center. Doctors say he was diagnosed when a friend was home to the hospital, and Lengshang\u2019s symptoms started in the morning and were worsening after getting out of bed for work. His blood pressure was 196/109, which is the normal range.\n\u201cThese blood pressures are actually very high, even with a normal birthweight, so that\u2019s a problem. There is a high chance that it is stroke and the only way to go about it is from not being able to control the blood pressure.\u201d\n\u201cOur friend was a patient suffering from a stroke. He was a bit scared of it, but we had no prior experience on treating this type of stroke,\u201d said Dr. Lei Wang at the Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke Center at the Beijing Vascular Research Center.\nDr. Wang said that this is a small stroke in the case of most people where there is the \u201cblood clot\u201d and the bleeding can be quite severe in kids. But this case goes far beyond a minor blood clot in a child. They are much worse:\nThey are a bit of an insult to the family. There was a lot of pain and discomfort and many difficulties with life. They have been with us all this time. They still need to be cured.\n\u201c"], "4": ["Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention? I have some notes in the comments section relating to heart attack and stroke. So in this post, I'll try to answer some questions you may have. What recommendations do you give on heart attack prevention? What do you think? Do people have a risk factor for CVD? What about CVD risk factors? What are lifestyle risk factors and why should I change lifestyle risk factors? What resources exist for people with CVD? What are some resources available for people with cancer, etc. I think this is a good question... I'd love to know answers to these. But first: why is it important to have a plan and an assessment of a person's risk profile? People make mistakes and don't even try to lose weight if they're obese. So many people don't know what risk profile they have, or what to look for to have a plan, or when to do it. How do you calculate your personal risk profile? If you're a family planning and reproductive health advocate, you wouldn't give a number. But for your healthcare providers when making referrals, numbers are very important. How do you decide if a client has a risk factor for CVD or is overweight? They typically go for a lipid profile that can tell them about LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. The question of if they're overweight is more complicated than just calculating LDL and HDL. People with severe obesity can be overweight. What can happen if they're obese? Are they more at risk if they smoke? Are they at risk with type 2 diabetes? Are they at risk with hypertension? What questions should I ask my person to have a heart risk assessment? 1) What are your age, sex, races, and ethnic background? 2) What are you eating? I recommend you talk about these together with your healthcare provider. 3) What is your height? Do you know your height percentile? There are some limitations when it comes to the test, but for the purposes of this post, I'm going to use a 180-point height percentile range. 4) What are your sex? Which one did you get your sex of diagnosis from? This is easy to do, and the difference between sex and gender can be confusing. What are your sexual partners? 5) What is your race? If you're Latino, you might be more at risk and there are some things the healthcare provider can do to be specific (e.g. what medications to use). 6) Do you have diabetes? It's important to look at the types of diabetes, and what type it is (e.g. type 1, type 2). 7) What are your cholesterol levels? What is your HDL in grams per 100 ml? Are they in the healthy range (e.g. lower HDL or higher HDL)? What kind of risk is there? This needs to be more specific than 180 for everyone with CVD. So what should we be looking for? What are some lifestyle risk factors? 1) Physical activity 2) No smoking 3) No or very low alcohol intake 4) No or low consumption of saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, cholesterol and sodium intake 5) No or low consumption of sugar, sucrose, sucrose, simple fruit juice/water, fruit juice/water, fructose consumption, honey consumption, chocolate consumption, baked products, fried foods, fast foods, restaurant foods, takeaways, etc. 6) No or relatively low intake of saturated fats and trans fat, and so forth. 2) Eat more fruits and vegetables 9 servings of fruits with at least 80% of fruit intake, or 1\u00bd-2 cups of vegetables, or some combination thereof (e.g. with some green leafy vegetables) 3) No or moderately low fructose intake 5-6% of your daily calorie intake\nI'm doing the exercise in my heart and I have a good understanding of it.

Can people of the age of 50, 60 or more develop cardiovascular disease if they smoke? 2. Who is this person, and what is he doing for the rest of his life? 3. The answer to these questions is \"no.\" But you may still want an examination. Here is a sample of a question with a correct answer:", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention? The guideline on prevention of chronic CVDs in UK and USA states that \"carcinogenic exposure levels should be set at or below 2500 m3/d, based on evidence of a protective effect of cigarette smoking in this group at the 50% level in the last year\" with data on current consumption of alcohol coming from the Health Survey for England, which are from 2011.\nCardiovascular disease deaths are lower among older adults and people in countries with lower levels of smoking, says a review published in the BMJ. There is limited evidence on how and why the rates were falling, but some might be due to better treatment of cardiovascular diseases, more frequent screening, changes in tobacco smoke from the current ban on smoking, and restrictions of nicotine-containing products.\nA meta-analysis published in the BMJ looked at the effect of changes in smoking status and/or cigarettes on heart disease in the general population, especially at all life stages. The study was a combination of randomised and nonrandomised trials and it showed that smoking can lower risk of heart disease but does not necessarily apply to older people and those with high levels of nicotine. The analysis also showed significant reductions in deaths and deaths were only partially attenuated for those with low or average smoking levels. Most deaths had occurred after age 75, 0-60 years, men and more than 25% of deaths were from coronary heart disease (CHD). The analysis showed that smoking cessation for at least 1 year is not likely to improve the outcomes of any health service.\nIn the UK, new recommendations to combat smoking, called a smoke withdrawal plan for treatment, had been put in place some years ago, but implementation remains largely lacking. In the US, the Department of Health and Human Services has established a smoking cessation program targeting smokers who want to quit. These are managed using the ICH-RFPQ-83, developed after 1980 to address smoking, nicotine and other tobacco products use by the population, and smoking causes and associated diseases.", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention? NICE has a task of reviewing the evidence and deciding on the best practice and guidance for treatment of CVD according to the clinical judgement of the patient and the context within which the patient behaves (a good example of this is to have a 60-year-old smoker check with NICE that could then choose to seek care from GP or hospital services who can provide free advice in the event of a risk of CVD or at any other time). NICE are setting a limit of up to 20\u201325% reduction in overall premature CVD risk if these specific criteria are met for someone at risk of CVD. The overall prevalence of coronary heart disease is 350 000 in the US and if that prediction is based solely on age and a 5% reduction in age based CVD risk (with that 5% cut-off value the NICE recommendation would be reduced to 17 500). This is likely to lead to a 8% reduction in cardiovascular events in people at risk of CVD if they also benefit from CVD risk reduction as a result. However, NICE also set a 2% - if the probability of CVD is 1 in 50, a reduction of 10 to 15% are likely to have considerable benefit but a reduction of 95% is not likely to be desirable in general.\nCVD Risk Reduction Recommendations in China:\n- Screening \u2013 screening\n- Screening - smoking and a number of health risk factors;\n- Treating \u2013 treating \u2013 all cardiovascular diseases (see below)\n- Managing \u2013 management\n- Avoiding smoking \u2013 smoking\n- Preventing stroke \u2013 stroke Prevention\n- Managing diabetes \u2013 management of type 2 diabetes\n- Reducing excess body weight\n- Modifiable \u2013 reducing risk of non-communicable diseases\n- Modifiable \u2013 treating\n- Preventing vascular dementia\n- Treating - Dementia\n- Manage \u2013 managing\n- Monitoring and treating \u2013 monitoring\nThere are two important points worth being kept in mind by NICE:\n- We have to take into account each person\u2019s life style as well as their risk profile of CVD, even if it is not in a perfectly standardised way. There are many exceptions, and in fact people make many mistakes themselves. It is a very rare case where, after a period of lifestyle change, an adverse effect does develop spontaneously.

This guideline has been developed according to the findings from 89 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the results of which provided evidence concerning the effect of different smoking cessation interventions over an average follow up of 15 years. This guideline includes an assessment, by the NICE review group, of current evidence and discusses the clinical context for the management of risk factors specific to the individual patient.\nThe literature regarding the use of different behavioural strategies to reduce CVD risk has been reviewed by the World Economic Forum for use in managing conditions such as cardiovascular disease, asthma, and multiple sclerosis.\n- NICE GUIDELINES FOR TREATING CHEST FACE DISEASE, MORTALITY AND VASCULAR DISEASE IN THE CHILD PORTION.\n- NICE Guidance for Preventing CV Disease in Chinese Children:\n1. Screening \u2013 screening- Screening-screening is the first-line method to identify the risk for serious CV disease or CVD when it occurs. A positive screening test should be obtained within the range of 0 to 10, and a screening test result should be available within the range of 0 to 13, and if no results are obtained from the screening test, then a medical report obtained from a medical practitioner may be required. If the screening test result is positive, then a clinical referral to the NSC will need to be made and the next phase of pre-clinical screening will be to determine the risk factor set and then the medical referral can follow up if possible. The NSC will also perform a comprehensive physical exam at the time of assessment.\n2. Screening.

These are the things that should be reflected as part of the patient record and identified and managed in people who are at high risk for heart disease.\"\nSecond, NICE states:\n\"This includes the pattern of smoking (defined as whether it was current or absent in the past six months) and/or whether it was regular (yes or no) or used regularly (continuous, even if not frequent) and if it occurred during 2009-14. We believe that it is important to be able to predict from lifestyle factors [ie risk for CVD] who will become clinically vulnerable if individuals decide to be physically active... and who will become clinically vulnerable if they do not take active steps to increase their physical activity to reduce their risk of having a heart attack.\u201d\nThird, NICE states:\n\"The assessment of CVD risk takes into account age, sex, ethnicity, family socioeconomic factors including education, lifestyle, comorbidities, and genetic, chronic health issues such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperglycaemia, and overweight. All of these factors and individual-level risk factors associated with CVD are assessed.\"", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention? In order to do so, you would need to show evidence of a protective effect against CVD.

We are working towards determining the risk of a cardiovascular event which could be increased, or decreased, when a patient is a part of the general practice setting. This could be a new tool which can provide a good measure of risk for which to evaluate new guidelines regarding risk reduction. For clinicians treating patients within the general practice setting, this will be significant as the patient is part of the overall health management programme. We may begin to evaluate more risk stratification in older patients who regularly attend general practice, but the data that we have provided at this time is incomplete. We will need to look further into this subject with our clinical guidelines.", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention? In our case, we would say, \u201cwe\u2019re not dealing with CVD prevention as a specific population.\u201d\nA study commissioned by NICE showed that 14.7% of children and young people with GP health information from 2012 can be prevented from cardiovascular disease before they visit a GP's surgery, 15.7% - 52% of children and young people with GP health information can be prevented from CVD after they arrive at their GP's surgery, and 12.9% of children can be prevented from CVD if they visit the NHS to speak with a GP\". These numbers represent only the proportion of parents who could protect their child against cardiovascular disease - in the USA we are more likely to see a couple of people 'preventing' a cardiac event because they have children than to see their parents taking an active role.\n\"Our findings suggest that children and young people with GP health information are in an active, yet often invisible, preventive role, and therefore have the potential to protect cardiovascular outcomes and minimise the harms of their early presentation or the later treatment of cardiovascular disease in adults and to some extent in children and adolescents\".\nTo put it another way - as children and adolescents who have GP health information from the start of their GP care at the beginning of their life are often the ones most likely to get pre-diagnosed at the earliest age, they are in a position to start developing a life-long risk management strategy for controlling risks of cardiovascular events.\nThe main finding of the NICE guidelines is that when it comes to people in UK's healthcare system, the health professional can play an important role in stopping cardiovascular risk factors in people before they come to contact with the healthcare system. There may be other people we could contact (or ask them about) to discuss this risk-taking with, but this could be in the context of our health professionals.\nThe study authors believe that in the context of the wider UK health system this \"can potentially save the lives of at-risk young people and may have additional benefits for other vulnerable individuals\".\nWhat do you think?

The patient might also be asked to undergo some physical exercise, even if he or she is at a moderate risk level and is not taking medication.\nSome patients might be able to return to their normal activities after a year through lifestyle interventions or medications, as the medication was meant to help maintain their health.\nThere are, however, different views about whether heart failure patients return to activity after six months, four months, or six months following a year of medication alone.\nMore patients may need to continue monitoring their exercise, whether through a medical review in 6 or 12 months, and possibly be given a 60-minute cardio session every 2 weeks if possible.\nWould the patients who are receiving medication in the hospital have access to medication or a clinic where they can self-administer?\nIf patients were able to have access to all four health measures at birth, then they would have access to medication or a clinic where they could do so.\nWhat would the treatment approach be for patients who have had a heart-attack, stroke, etc.?\nYour patient has likely had previous health-related interventions and has probably also been on lifestyle recommendations or medication.

This is a 74-year-old male, who smoked for 11 years. NICE guidelines for CVD prevention recommend the prevention of some types of non-fatal CVD, and there are few guidelines for CHD prevention. This is because few people have the same risk factors as patients with CVD, and there are no easy methods to lower or prevent CVD among high-risk individuals. To help prevent CHD, these guidelines advise that the following measures need to taken: Smoking cessation; exercise; blood pressure control; blood cholesterol treatment plan; weight reduction and dietary intervention; diet and exercise management of obesity; cessation use of tobacco and smoking cessation from at least 15 years of age. Smoking cessation is a very significant point in prevention, since, even if a patient does not stop smoking during the course of 15 years, it can lead to a cascade of cardiovascular risks. These guidelines focus on these major components of prevention and emphasize that a complete cessation strategy should be considered by patients, with an individualised step-by-step approach. If the patient has a family history of CVDs, then, smoking cessation should not be initiated until the patient's blood pressure is <130 over >90. Weight and physical activity also need to be kept to a minimum. Patients with obesity are of course at higher risk of CVDs. The 70-year-old patient is not at all high risk of CVDs, and that may well make them not be concerned by their CHD risk. As patients are being counselled about CVD, the 25-year-old male is not the best patient for such a specific topic, because of the possibility that he may be at risk for a specific type of CVD. But when we look at CVD risk for the 30-year-old patient here, there's very little concern about her CVD risk than the 30-year-old male, who is not at risk from CVDs. The same is true with women, who are a very relatively common population that we've had to look at, but are at a higher risk of CVDs than men. Cardiovascular disease risk is more strongly associated with obesity, and to some degree with smoking. If we consider the 25-year-old patient from the other end of the age range, who is 74 years old, then a complete ban of tobacco would be of benefit, since he is already at very high risk for CVDs. The 70-year-old patient and the 25-year-old male were not particularly well suited to take preventive measures that a patient could choose from based on their individual risk factors. And now we understand that, while it is a medical decision, a decision on taking risk factors of CVDs should be based solely on a patient-specific process. I personally strongly believe that people who are at least 70-years-old should be told in advance and have a plan to help prevent CVD. A plan, which should have a very specific scope, would give a patient priority to that plan, rather than just taking a generic approach that is based on the person as we've seen with CVD risk. All this is important when talking about prevention, because there's a great deal of evidence that cardiovascular risk is actually increasing for every other chronic disease in the United States. That means that we're really seeing the results of those interventions, for example, as a result of an increase in diabetes (diabetes, heart disease and stroke - all of these) than from smoking. Now, this is another big message from this part of my field, and it is a bit confusing for patients without a medical background in this area. The fact is, most of what we've seen as a result of that increase in CVD, is happening in the elderly population. This is very important not only there for physicians but for patients as well. Because most patients think these risk factors are of a demographic concern, but they're of a disease concern. They could be a great measure to help limit CVD risk in the elderly. It might, in fact, be the right thing for them to do. But patients with CVD are often not told that there is a risk that is of a particular nature, much less about other diseases. The fact", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention? What role will they play in guiding the design of these guidelines?\nTo understand the role of NICE guidance in the design of CVD prevention guidelines, we first need to understand what is different about current guidelines (guidelines) and recommendations, and how do they relate to the recommendations for CVD prevention.\nCurrent guidelines are based on evidence from epidemiological studies and meta-analysis to help create a summary of the available evidence relating to different outcomes of CVD.\nThese guidelines provide a \u201cpreceding research base\u201d and focus on evidence related to all of the main causes of CVD, specifically CVD, stroke, and MI. They identify and provide a comprehensive list of risk factors, prevention strategies, and resources for individuals at the start of their health journey. These guidelines also consider available screening results.\nFurther, NICE has defined CVD as a \u201cmedical condition relating to health and death which is related to the long-term health of the individuals\u201d.\nIt refers to non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and heart disease. The NICE guidance will consider the context where the guidelines are developed, the specific clinical features of the conditions, and the risks of each outcome. Each individual-based guideline presents information pertaining to a specific condition, and how this may be used to improve health.\nNICE has published a draft of the guidelines in 2021.\nThese guidelines will help improve health-related outcomes for individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease to assist people to make effective lifestyle changes that can help reduce their risk of CVD, and ultimately decrease the risk of suffering a first heart attack, stroke, or death from the condition.\nIn the NICE guideline, the focus is on screening and treating risk factors. Screening involves identifying potential CVDs in individuals without identifiable risk factors, and in some cases, identifying risk factors that need to be altered or treated to reduce the risk of developing CVD. There can be a number of screening tests, or methods, for detecting CVD in individuals at risk of having a heart attack or stroke.\nRisk factors to be aware of and identified for the NICE guideline include blood pressure (BP) >130 over 80 mmHg, total cholesterol \u22657.6 mmol/L, plasma glucose <125 mg/dL, high serum creatinine 1.0-1.3 mg/dL, a body mass index (BMI) \u226530 kg/m2, high HDL cholesterol <4.2 mmol/L, AHC Group 02/08, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol >4.5 mmol/L/year, total cholesterol \u22653.5 mmol/L, smoking \u22652 packs/week, hypertension \u2265140/90 mm Hg, diabetes mellitus, and alcohol consumption >100g/day.\nThe NICE guideline also mentions that individuals with a greater risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (e.g., those with a history of CVD, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, or smoking) who have had one or more of these diagnoses must also be screened for high risk characteristics in addition to all individuals who do not fall into these risk categories.\nIn the NICE guideline, the focus is on a number of steps to increase cardiovascular health. These steps include monitoring blood pressure, increasing physical activity over time, eating a heart-healthy diet, managing blood sugar, and avoiding tobacco. The guidelines also recommend screening for specific risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia), and include measures to help individuals in the high risk categories reduce their risk.\nAnother key element of the guideline is the implementation of specific intervention programmes. The NICE guideline recommends screening at least once every decade starting at age 50 and continuing until age 75. The guidance also mentions that the interventions should encompass all cardiovascular risk factors.\nIndividuals at high risk of CVD through risk factors are advised to get screened at least once every decade starting from 50, and continuing until age 90.\nIn addition to screening and treatment, the guidelines recommend having a balanced diet that includes foods from healthy whole foods, which include fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and a variety of whole grains. The guidelines also recommend changing high cholesterol/hypertension levels (T2D) with a combination of lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise.\nThe NICE guideline is part of the \u201cClinical Practice Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease in older people\u201d (2020).

A final point in the report is that \"the most vulnerable population groups (women \u2265 50 years old, patients with a current risk factor, individuals with an existing risk factor) should be the first identified when the risk factors are not in the optimal range, while \"the next-to-least vulnerable population should be the first identified when there is a risk factor, or more appropriately when there is potential evidence of an effect.\" All of these points are in line with the ASC Guidelines and have been identified as setting the foundation for future trials and research.\n\"Our approach recognises the importance of an individualised program.\"", "Considering the specifics of John's health profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, BMI of 30, blood pressure at 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol at 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD - what NICE guidelines would apply for CVD prevention?\n\"We have reviewed the literature and can conclude that we can use the recommendations in this guideline when prescribing antihypertensive therapy in patients with this common cause of CVD,\" said the director of the NICE guideline development unit, Jasmine Maudy, MRS. \"At present, they focus on preventing heart attack and stroke, and the risk groups - hypertensive people, diabetics, and people that have a history of myocardial infarction. Our guidelines do not prescribe these drugs for people because of their increased risk. However, individuals with no or very low blood pressure, no history of MI, etc., may have a greater risk with hypertension, and they could benefit from treatment.\"\nWhat is the role of a GP in prescribing antihypertensive therapy?\n\"When people are seeing a GP,\" said the NICE guideline development team, \"they will usually recommend a \"first-line\" or'standard' dose of antihypertensives for them. However, most clinicians are only on prescribing 'trial' drugs that have little evidence of benefit and side effects, which is why we are seeing very high numbers of patients needing to be treated with alternative drugs as first-line prescriptions.\" In response to the increased use of antihypertensive regimens, such as valsartan, the NICE guidelines suggest using different medications or combinations, such as potassium citrate and sodium nitrate, to get blood pressure back to the target range.\nWhere are we now in prescribing antihypertensive medications for heart attack and stroke patients?\n\"In general, non-inferiority was reported in randomised controlled trials that we could find for hypertension in patients at high-risk of CV death. However, patients who are at risk of CV death cannot be appropriately targeted and are treated with medications at lower doses,\" explained Dr. Maudy. \"Most of the non-inferiority was reported for either an initial initial dose of 5mg/kg e-buplets or 248mg e-buplets. However, the results are somewhat limited for a large number of patients. We cannot tell whether patients who choose to lower the initial dosage of e-buplets or e-buplets are more likely to get worse rather than better. Further studies are required, including a wider range of antihypertensive studies.\"\nWhat are the implications of the recommendations for clinicians and the public?\n\"The recommendations in this guideline will be useful for clinicians as it provides the information needed to make a judgement call. They will be useful as part of a continuum of care - whether it is a patient with hypertension or a patient with a previous stroke,\" added Dr. Maudy. \"This is why the guideline is based upon a large, robust scientific evidence base, not on patients' subjective preferences. The evidence base was supported by the British Hypertension Society's (BHS) guidelines. We need to see the evidence base on the effects of antihypertensive medication to develop appropriate guidance.\"\nThe advice from the NICE guidelines was accepted by the British Medical Association Scientific Committee by consensus on 10 June 2017.\nMore information: Jan-Andreas Eberhard, Danielne Veldkamp, Laura Rau, Markus Guttman, Mark S.

Can they be adapted for Chinese patients and how might they work?\nThe first guideline we discussed was a recommendation for a standard weight control program for patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease that has been endorsed by experts. That included:\n- A healthy lifestyle aimed at a reduction of waist circumference through weight reduction and physical activity\n- Low-carbohydrate diets with a daily target consumption of about 50 grams of carbohydrates from all sources\n- Fasting blood screening to determine whether patients meet the 70% target for CVD, or if it's needed at 50%\n- A lifestyle assessment with an NICE-delivered physical fitness assessment\nThe second guideline was one addressing the importance of screening for cardiovascular disease early in the course of a patient's life (a family history of CVD or high triglyceride levels). This type of screening also might involve lifestyle changes or blood pressure or blood glucose testing depending upon individual circumstances. Some of the most appropriate lifestyle changes will probably include:\n- Exercise - resistance training (strength and/or flexibility) on three to four days every week\n- Low carbohydrate diets if necessary, and\n- Healthy lifestyle choices, such as avoiding smoking and alcohol\n- Weight loss if necessary\nThe third guideline was a high-intensity exercise plan - something of concern to many with a history of CVD in general. For patients with a history of CVD, such as those in the Chinese context, there is a need for a 20\u201330 minute workout on a daily basis to meet the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's recommendation of 150\u2013200 minutes of vigorous activity each week. Those who are in sufficient readiness as a model, or who have never met that number before, might not meet the guideline, and there are numerous reasons for that. However, if an individual has completed one or more high-intensity resistance training sessions in 3\u201310 weeks as well as any other exercise that has proven to be effective, then they're clearly moving closer to meeting the benchmark as they age.\nThe fourth guideline is an intervention program for individuals with hypertension to improve their blood pressure control while minimizing heart attacks and strokes. This was a group of people who would have had a 7.0 mm Hg systolic or diastolic pressure greater than or equal to 160/ 90 mm Hg before cardiovascular event prevention had been a principal goal. This patient population would most likely have benefitted from an intervention program and had an earlier CVD risk history. For such patients, there are several variables they must consider including:\n- Having hypertension, smoking, and history of heart disease, or had a first cardiac event\n- Regular physical exercise\n- A BMI of \u226525 (low risk if BMI is between 20 and 25)\n- A history of a family history of CVD (either a family member with a history or a relative)\n- Cardiovascular risk measures, such as high family history, smoking, or history of hypertension\nThe fifth recommendation is for community-based primary care, specifically, for high-risk individuals > 60 years old, who are likely to have an increased CVD risk. The current guidelines for cardiopulmonary secondary care suggest recommending a 20-minute walk at least every third week. This suggests a 200-minute regimen, but we believe it's unlikely that 21-30 minutes would be sufficient for this population.\nFinally, the sixth guideline was a lifestyle intervention program designed to improve the control and adherence to a low-fat diet and exercise program. In particular, we would recommend:\n- Weight loss\n- Reduced carbohydrate intake\n- Stopping smoking\n- Drinking less alcohol\n- Exercise programs\n- Healthy lifestyles (eating patterns, such as increasing in fruit and/or vegetables and being more physically active)\n- Weight reduction & healthy diet. This is also the type of exercise that has the greatest benefit with long term results\n- Regular doctor visits for evaluation & treatment if needed\n- Monitoring for blood lipid levels and for cardiovascular disease\n- Reducing the use of tobacco.\nThere are no major complications from these methods. For healthy people, a balanced lifestyle reduces their risk of CVD-related illnesses. However, the impact on CVD is usually modest. In general, we recommend that lifestyle changes be made as a strategy, rather than as an inevitable step in the course of any course of CVD prevention and control.\nAbout the Author: David Pessanu is a senior lecturer at the Heart and Stroke Royal Hospital in London now working for British Society for Intensive care Medicine and"], "5": ["What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\nFirst, we need to know how to evaluate each clinical pathway of CVD:\n- what blood pressure is too high, high too low or a balance between the two?\n- what does the history say about past exposure to the same types of foods or other risk factors?\n- which risk factors were high?\n- which risk factors are low?\n- which risk factors are very high\n- how many people might have the same risk factors and at the same time?\n- what would that mean about his or her risk for future CVD risk in general anyway?\n- what risk factors can most easily tell you how to prepare for CVD?\n- is a BMI that is under 25 too low?\nSecond, we need to know each clinical pathway of CVD:\n- how does your risk factor impact the chance that you will develop CVD?\n- is your risk of developing CVD as high or low as a person without a history of CVD?\n- is your risk of developing CVD as high or low as someone with a family history of CVD?\n- does your risk for developing CVD go up or down?\n- what makes you think that you might have any type of CVD at all?\nThird, we need to be able to assess your lifestyle?\n- is he or she doing something to reduce the risk of developing CVD?\n- is he or she doing something to reduce the risk of developing CVD and increase the risk for future CVD?\n- can he or she do something about what he or she is doing?\n- what could be the consequences of not doing that?\nFourth, we need to be able to assess your response to any intervention that might help reduce your risk for developing CVD.\n- does it help reduce your risk of developing CVD?\n- when is at least one hour less active than it used to be?\n- does it help with your weight loss?\n- does it help to reduce your cholesterol?\n- does it help to reduce your blood pressure?\nFifth, we need to be able to measure that change in your health and develop a plan tailored for your individual needs.\n- has your health changed by more than 20%?

Most people would not know if this was a question about any type of disease. Why do we need to ask a broad question about lifestyle changes to help people to make changes as they approach coronary heart disease and other CVD?\nThe main goal of the book that we are focusing on is to get a good foundation for those in our practices to actually determine how much and how often can you encourage your patients to participate in lifestyle modifications. We need to look at the risk of CVD and the risk of coronary heart disease. We want to create the framework to make sure people know where to begin to change their way of life.", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD? We're just looking at John. My guess would be that you're looking at a little more conservative, in that you're not aiming to get an entirely high-risk patient. This is an important topic, because cardiovascular disease is a major cause of deaths around the world. So we've all had to put somebody on a \"pre-hypertensive list\" to have them see an HTM. It's not that hard for doctors and the NICE guideline team to get these things right. They have an agreed-upon definition of CVD. So they might have a slightly different approach, and they've just gone into the definition very broadly and they're saying, well, just get 10% from diet, 25% from exercise, 50% from lifestyle and lifestyle may well be enough to reduce your risk of CVD. So you're saying at least that maybe you're getting around 20% from lifestyle or if you have diabetes you can take less and that's that. Now that's a lot of ideas - we've got over 11,000 ways of looking at CVD so this is one of those areas, which is really, really difficult to pin out how it relates to CVD. It seems that a lot of people think that lifestyle change could be very efficient. It seems that if you look at what's going on when people go down the treadmill, they can certainly make a number of changes that will just not impact on the number of other things that they are going to do that are also going to impact on their CVD, namely stopping smoking, not taking medication that may cause your heart rhythm problems, quitting smoking, and maybe cutting out alcohol and lessening stress. The thing about this, that there's just been a lot of resistance to that and many people say, you can't just just do that. They argue that you need to have an intervention protocol, and that is kind of just a lot of people, some people may want to implement that, and some people don't want to. So when we're going that out there the other question is, is there really anything that can be done? The NICE guideline in question is not specific enough. There's still so much to do, I do not think we have the amount of people who have been taking any effective lifestyle interventions in their health and they stop smoking, and the other stuff that we are looking at is, you can't just do that by talking to them about their lifestyle changes and then make them get those lifestyle interventions and go through it as a family member or as a partner or as an employee. So we still need to go in this context of trying to improve your cardiovascular health, and to do that the individual doctor might not be the one to set those outcomes, but they really have to do some sort of follow-up. If you're doing that, you're essentially aiming at a patient, and it would be like, \"It would take about 16 and a half years, and we need to get rid of 20 to 30 things that we have in the healthcare system and go and look for ways to achieve this. We need to do the things that they would have a very negative effect on their cardiovascular risk, and we need to get them to start doing things that they're doing now as they'll have the information about what might be a good thing to do,\" or similar. But in my experience, there is a lot of resistance around this. So it's not what we're thinking. We actually are focusing more on interventions, not about interventions and then we need to understand why people do good and go about these things and then we just need to give them the chance to do these things. The guideline says that the best way to do that, although it says they recommend lifestyle interventions, rather than lifestyle changes, is maybe get rid of that bad stuff, so smoking cessation, or if they've had a heart attack, or are just going to get those other therapies. That is different from getting rid of it and sticking with the current one or trying to cut that down. Because I think they really need to look at it more in a holistic way as an individual. So one, how do we get individuals to change their lifestyle? What are some things that can be done now and if they're going to work that work, could we even be doing the same thing tomorrow that's working? So what other things are people talking about, for example, if we have a patient going through life, can they talk about those things?

There is almost certainly something in common between these two cases.\nIt may just be my understanding; John's blood pressure and cholesterol are the same, so he is a carrier of this genetic risk factor. I'm not sure if this is the case in my son either, so I'm wondering...\nAs far as the \"present diagnosis\" is concerned, it may be that John is a healthy relative, and is therefore a carrier of this genetic risk factor.\nThe information that John has on the NICE (formerly the NHS) website is based on the fact that John's blood pressure and cholesterol are consistent, and the information that he has on his parents is reasonable - and, in this situation, I agree that the parents should be aware of this.\nTo further explain the issue by including John in the scenario, what do you think could be a possible way of identifying and monitoring John's risk before it gets too large?\nIn order to be able to use NICE guidelines, there must be at least one diagnosis on the NICE website. If a patient can't be classified as someone who is diagnosed with CVD, this can't be used in prescribing treatment.\nIn the above scenario, which of the next two options do you think are reasonable for John's condition?\nJohn was diagnosed in the initial consultation; he has been managed, he has been given treatments, and, most importantly, he has been screened for cardiovascular risk factors. If John's blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides are consistent in his family, then these would be the possible causes of his condition.\nIf John's family has a history of CVD, then those other causes must be considered.\nIf John could be identified as having a history of CVD, then what would the NICE guidelines be on this? Are there symptoms that can be looked for?\nIf John is diagnosed with an unhealthy lifestyle, then he should be monitored continuously for cardiovascular risk factors. There is a good chance that age has some bearing on the symptoms that this could present, so symptoms should be monitored (as John would have symptoms that were present while he was in normal health).\nFor John, there are two types of signs - a change in symptoms and a change in BMI (Body Mass Index) - which would indicate his condition might be higher than other people.\nWhat additional risk factors does John have?\nIn order to identify such risks further, the NHS may be able to provide a doctor with a blood test for several variables, such as:\nIf I'm concerned that John might be experiencing risk factors above listed, then what is next? Who might I contact to make an appointment?\nThe NICE (formerly the NHS) website is a very useful place to find out more about your risks. For the reasons just mentioned, if John or anyone in John's family has a history of CVD, then they can be tested, and medical advice can be given for management of risk factors such as weight gain, poor diet, smoking, and alcohol intake.", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\nI don't know what the relevant data were - you seem confused with how you want medical advice - but you have my best apologies for your misunderstanding of the relevant data.\nAs far as knowing where the patient is when asking for help - I can say we can't use \"we need to know\" for the definition of how to ask for help. But why do we need to? We need help - we need the doctor. And we need our doctor to agree whether we should ask for help or be done.\nAlso, to say the word \"help\" is to claim that you can do something without help - which is wrong.\n- To say \"do something with the help of (someone else)\" is a better word.\nI know that it might make some sense that you are \"giving\" to (someone) but that it isn't.\nI am the doctor too, but I cannot make myself available - by helping the patient out of the dilemma.\n- Can the word \"do something\" here only refer to a task you are doing? The word refers to what?\n- Where is John's problem? How much money have you already saved?\n- What is John's age? Where is his job?\n- What is the total cholesterol and total fasting blood sugar?\n- How many people in his family have diabetes?\n- Why is John in a depression?\n- What is the medication he is taking, and what does the medication do?\n- What is the drug he is on, and what does his doctor advise?\n- Which is the treatment being given?

It recommends that older men and women in that study are at increased risk for heart failure, although it does not suggest whether that increased risk is due to aging or to smoking history.\nThe question I posed was to determine how well your own lifestyle influences your heart health. The answer will not immediately be immediate - but because everyone else in the world has health issues and knows it, the next great thing you should be concerned about is how the people in your life understand yourself and have the resources or access to resources that you need to improve your health. You will benefit from your friends, friends\u2019 and family who understand you and work to improve the situation. I think the most important thing - I have heard other doctors say - is that all of your relationships have been improved because you have become healthier. All of the resources put in place to improve and protect your health now also prevent future major health issues.\nLet me know what you're thinking: How much health can you afford to make? If all the people in this world were healthy, the money available for these people would be unlimited. I believe all people in this world are going to receive some type of compensation for this wealth. This means we all deserve to be healthier and happier - all the benefits we get from investing in our health, but also the money we're spending on things which are not in our interests.\nMy hope is that it will bring you the sense of pride that you're saving yourself the cost of health care that you probably are going to pay for a few years, and be more confident in your current health due to the fact that you're better off when aging isn't a problem.\nIf you like this, the book you're looking for is called, \"Crown of the Valley: The Case for Nutrition.\" You can find it out on youtube here, or you can visit www.crownOfThe Valley.com.", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\n\nThe key word to use is \"should\". If it is helpful to the reader, then yes, John should be considered a normal man as per the NICE recommendations. The criteria for the diagnosis of coronary heart disease are:\n\n\u2022 Time to develop chest pain at the time of exercise\n\u2022 Duration of pain, not by activity, and not by an exercise event,\n\u2022 Symptom presence upon or after exercise when there are significant warning signs of a serious cardiovascular event.\n\nThis should be given in a clinical judgment. I suggest that this \"CPR\" would be applicable for John, for example:\n\u2022 An angina that's very serious, but there are no warning signs,\n\u2022 A low platelet count that's significantly too low to cause any clinically significant symptoms.\n\u2022 A significant weight gain that's not related to weight loss.\n\u2022 A heart rate rate that's too low to be low-sensitivity and has no heart rhythms (or no abnormal heart murmurs) and has no history of a past stroke.\n\u2022 A sudden shortness of breath (or dyspnea) in people with underlying heart disease, which should not be ignored.\n\nSo, John, we've got a condition that can pose threats to the survival of heart patients and all possible precautions. We've set the parameters of the diagnosis and so if John is above 35 or more years, we can consider it as a diagnosis for him. We also need to give the relevant history before we get to that decision. If he has diabetes, then the disease burden is much higher not only due to the cost of their treatment and the cost of the surgery, but also due to the risk of secondary complications, like blindness, dementia, or chronic kidney disease. So, he should be part of the decision making.\n\nHe should not be put off by anything in the \"normal\" range. Any disease with a normal history is in the normal range, just because they're healthy is not a problem. Also, he doesn't need to be treated like an older person. He didn't get an accident, the first time he ever did it, or he didn't smoke, the last time he actually smoked, or the last time people started drinking - so he can't go on and become addicted. And so we need to stress the importance of a full and complete physical examination. He should be checked by an angiologist who can do all the blood tests and he should undergo any other blood tests that might be relevant to his disease. And a history of coronary heart disease if he has diabetes (or high cholesterol) should be taken.\n\nWe would want to be certain that he had at least some of the things that are required for him not to get heart disease or die from it. We'd want that check up of a heart scan, of cholesterol tests, blood pressure measurements, and so upon diagnosis, he should be kept healthy and living his life as as he should. The key is the need for an appropriate life expectancy, no matter how healthy he is, and no matter what his age.\n\nAlso, John should not be put off by any symptoms that would point a heart disease and, in this case, diabetes. He has two different types of heart disease, and he can have both types of heart disease. It doesn't hurt to have one more to keep him alive.\n\u2013\u00a0bobby\nOct 28, 2012 at 19:51\n\u2022 Oh, I never thought of it that way. It's too hard on the heart to get heart disease. Is such a negative experience to a person, is it even a valid one that you're doing heart disease for such a long time? I'll ask you this again tomorrow, but the answer is yes - you'll have to think harder. I can see you had a heart attack before the diagnosis, did you have diabetes? Is it better to say \"there is no heart attack\" than \"I'm sorry I'm so out of shape\".

This information has been used by the Medical & Health Practitioners Association to inform the provision of training, and by the Scottish Qualifications Authority to inform the curriculum.\n\nFinally, your presentation includes an example of how you can interpret NICE guidelines in the healthcare context using a few key issues raised within the NICE guidelines:\n\n\u2022 Blood pressure is a key factor when you determine a patient's 'tricare' (low risk) level.\n\u2022 When you read a patient's medical history, the clinical presentation is of interest - do the numbers on the table differ from clinical presentation, or is the person responding differently to one approach to blood pressure than another?\n\u2022 Blood pressure has an effect on all cardiovascular parameters including the coronary risk.\n\n\u2022 Heart failure is a life-shortening condition - do you consider your patient's history of heart failure, or is your patient responding more negatively to a study?\n\n\u2022 Patients with heart failure are at a higher risk of developing stroke and sudden death, so this presentation is valuable for you, as you have read the NICE guidelines.\n\nJohn has a high blood pressure of 121/74 /116 mmHg, and a relative risk of 11 per 100 for coronary heart disease - how might you interpret this from this NICE guideline?\n\nThis NICE guideline has an example of your presentation -\n\nYour presentation looks at:\n\n1. The diagnosis of cardiovascular disease based in a patient's blood pressure.\n2. An interpretation of the data from the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease.\n3. How the NICE guidelines have been used by clinicians and colleagues to inform and support the delivery of care involving patients with cardiovascular risk.\n\n\nThe NICE guidelines you reviewed in your presentation are now considered as part of the NICE classification framework. We see your presentation as supporting the work that is being done by other clinicians in the NICE classification framework. Each NICE guideline provides guidance, based upon expert advice and best practice. One of the more relevant NICE findings that should be considered by your audience is the 'heart failure diagnosis' from NICE Guideline 18 (9/2012) - which suggests that this person could be at risk of heart failure. John is a 76 year old male with a BMI of 30, a total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, total blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, an ACE/ARACE ratio of 1.6/1.8, an HDL cholesterol of 90 mg/dL, a smoking status of 35 years, and a family history of CVD.\n\nIn NICE Guideline 18, you note the importance of'management' of heart failure. This recommendation states: \"Patients with heart failure should be offered supportive support strategies, and it should continue to be considered important to assist individuals with the lifestyle changes required to limit and manage the effects of HF.\"\n\nHow might you use this information in your presentation to explain your findings in Section 6 'Assessment' for how a patient in John's scenario would be assessed?\n\nIn order to justify John's increased risk of developing heart failure, he is referred by his GP to an EKG technician who is going to be performing an exercise stress test on him. The EKG technician makes a small cut and stitches in the back of John's eye - a common surgical skin procedure used to obtain biopsies. EKG technicians perform a very low voltage electrocardiogram (electroclinical), which has the ability to record electrocardiogram (ECG).\n\nDuring the exercise test, John is at risk of heart failure - is there some reason to assume that the EKG technician has a prior experience of this risk or that he would not have performed a low voltage electrocardiogram in John's case?\n\nAn electrocardiogram is an electrocardiogram which uses electrodes to monitor the activity of the heart - that is, the electrical activity of the heart. An electrocardiogram is a special recording technique which cannot be performed every week. An electrocardiogram recording is made from within the patient's chest, with the electrodes placed under the skin. Since John has a CVA (cardiovascular disease -", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\n\"If you're very young and very fit, you should eat a Mediterranean diet,\" says Dr. Vos. \"There is no point in restricting or eliminating specific foods or food groups. It just happens that when you eat it, those things won't do any real damage. When you eat fruits or vegetables full of phytonutrients, you reduce your risk for disease.\"\nOf course, people who want to follow a Mediterranean diet must eat healthfully, too. For example, Dr. Vos suggests avoiding fried foods, fatty meats, and dairy, along with avoiding or cutting back on foods with a high glycemic index, such as sweets, bread or refined pasta.\n\"It's a big difference between getting those nutrients in a plant-based diet and the standard Western diet, which is a very heavy load of processed foods,\" he says. While refined carbohydrates are bad, a lot of processed food isn't. Foods filled with sodium, such as salty frozen meals or processed breakfast cereals, are loaded with salt, too.\nInstead of frying fatty foods, Dr. Vos suggests blitzing them. In fact, he says, it's more beneficial to consume a lot of foods rich in omega-3s.\n\"So people need a lot [of food] in this plant-based diet for omega-3 fatty acids... in order to be able to process and use it. That's where the benefits end,\" he says.\nA Mediterranean diet can also help prevent or at least delay the onset of heart disease, and those who have a history of heart disease can have a significant impact.\nYou need to keep that in mind, and so do your clients. For young children under six, a little food should suffice. By adulthood, most healthy adult hearts will need a bit more.", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD? They also mention heartworm and smoking cessation. In other words, what do these things have in common with someone else in the public health community? I don't think there's much of a need. Perhaps people on public health campaigns shouldn't have anything in common with real-life doctors; as a society, they ought to know where these things are - just because they are popular does not make them useful or practical. (I am aware of the work carried out in the United States of America in that area.)", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?\nThe answer, of course, is negative. Not only does he have high blood cholesterol, he is not smoking and has a healthy body weight. He is not a normal smoker, he has no blood clots and his triglycerides are very low. He has a low HDL blood fat (good cholesterol), but his TG is very high. This combination of factors puts him at risk of a major cardiovascular event: a heart attack or stroke, all over the world. That's not surprising, seeing as his family is at high risk for cardiovascular disease.\nI also learned that in case you were wondering just who John would be and what a healthy lifestyle he would need some advice on, here it is:\nAccording to the US-Healthline, one in three Americans does not meet the recommended amount of daily calcium and iron intake. That is a big deal. An adult man over 40 with no history of disease and no chronic conditions should only be given 1000mg daily of vitamin D. An adult woman over 40 with no diseases and history of no cardiovascular disease or no other chronic condition should also receive vitamin D 3/2000 and 4500 IU, with a total of 3000 IU daily. The US recommends that 1500 - 3000 IU is the maximum.\n\"The FDA's recent report on calcium supplements also said that more research on their safety and effectiveness is necessary,\" said John.\n\"For people who already have a problem with calcium intake or would prefer to avoid taking it, calcium comes in pill form with liquid that you swallow, although other options such as citrate citrate (which contains citrate phosphate crystals) or sorbitol are available. There is debate as to whether citrate citrate is better than other options,\" he said.\nTo date, vitamin D has not shown to significantly change risk, but John does believe that he should be getting an iron supplement when possible.\n\"If you're already at an upper limit on iron (8-10 million parts per million), and you get a low blood lead level (>10ppm), you can get about a 5% benefit,\" John said.\n\"For people who have high blood pressure over 140/90, high blood cholesterol over 10 mmol/L or are overweight over 30 kg, I would take a higher iron and calcium level. People with heart history should also talk to a nurse before taking this,\" he said.\nTo get more information on all these topics, I urge you to contact 1-800-469-7999 if you want help.", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD?

The guideline would be that John's BMI needs to be further lowered by approximately 10% (since he has a low waist area and normal HDL).\nAnd what about a 150 year old man? We also would have to consider that although John's BMI is below average, the rest of his life has not suffered CVD. This makes fitting a new recommendation that the body mass index should be further lowered, as John would be a young male who has undergone a medical examination and some testing. He would however need to continue to maintain his previous weight.\nIn short, what our NICE guidelines recommend is that John's weight to be 50% less than the appropriate level for his age and sex (160 lbs for his height). That means that for most he would need to lose 5-10 kgs, and he would have to work out his calorie and BMI and continue this treatment plan for the next year.\nJohn's age and gender, 21 years, 70 kg, BMI 30, healthy body weight (BMI 15.5), smoking 6.6, medical history of diabetes, hypertension, family history of CVD, heart attacks, coronary artery and angina attacks and high blood pressure, current smoker, has a BMI of 4 kg/m2, an ideal waist and hip circumference of 1 1/ 2 inches, and a healthy eating plan. In brief, John is at a healthy weight with a strong heart and blood glucose level that is within the normal range. Since heart attack is an important risk for John's life, the health worker would have to exercise control of their blood pressure, cholesterol, blood glucose levels and monitor their eating habits. The practitioner would work with John to establish a well balanced diet that is low in sugar, fat and saturated fats, and he would get his doctor's approval to begin taking medication or other preventative measures.\nThe NICE guidelines were based on a very well designed research and research methodology in general. This was done and all the data collected was used to support the recommended recommendations.\nWe are happy to know that now we can provide reliable medical advice by simply visiting our website.

These statistics show that there is a non-significant increase in metabolic health risk in the smokers in comparison with non-smokers. This is seen with higher BMIs. The non-smokers and the smoking group showed different patterns (i.e. 240 is the 10-year maximum BMIs). The current smokers showed an overall reduction in total fat and high-density lipoproteins (the first line of defence to the negative effects of smoking) compared to the non-smokers. They also showed increased insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance and reduced abdominal fat and adiposity. However all the groups showed the same changes over time.

The 10% cut-off on this one is for 'total risk', not 'risk'.\n12 Apr 11, 10:31 PM17 1. If high cholesterol is at all your problem for you, you may be overdiagnosed. 12 Apr 11 16:20 PM18 1.

But I should note that the numbers should not be interpreted as indicating that one shouldn't get the product at all, or simply that they aren't necessary. That's not at all surprising. 16 Feb 11 01:29 PM19 2. There is a really good reason that the numbers don't agree. The reason why it doesn't agree is that it's not a really easy equation to define what counts as 'risk'. 14 Mar 11 11:48 PM19 3. This is not an easy equation to define, at least for me.

He also has no major chronic health complaints. He meets the criteria for CHD, and was offered a low-fat diet and a weight loss program that he is considering because he is overweight.\nThis is what I would advise:\nA diet high in polyunsaturated fats (with omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish and other cold-water fish), and also low in saturated fats, and especially cholesterol. The person should eat plenty of vegetables, especially leafy green vegetables. They should also include a range of nuts and healthy oils, and a regular exercise program.\nA doctor should be able to recommend lifestyle changes to meet the 5.5oz/8-11 cups of fruits and veggies that the patient should be consuming - as well as recommended supplements which the person might benefit from. (If he has diabetes, he needs to be able to identify what other things he needs to take, as in this case, insulin or other medications.) He should also talk and answer the questions in the Patient Information Guide to Cardiovascular Disease, as part of the assessment of the patient for this problem\nJohn is also asked to follow a Mediterranean Diet which is characterised by vegetables and legumes, whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and healthy fats like unsaturated fats and omega-3s - all of these are recommended for CVD prevention (with occasional restrictions, given his particular diet):\n- Avocados and olives\n- Nuts (tuna, pistachios, peanuts, almonds)\n- Olive oil\n- Healthy oils (olive, canola)\n- Fish (tuna, salmon, mackerel)\n- Green tea\n- Legumes: beans, peas, lentils, beans, chickpeas\n- Vegetables: asparagus, carrots, celery, eggplants, kale, mushrooms\nMeditation is recommended as part of the treatment for patients with CHD. There are no recommended doses of cannabis, since there aren't enough randomized trials in the USA (where it's legal). The US Food and Drug Administration requires that cannabis be given only if it is medically necessary; and the FDA only allows medical purposes when there is minimal proof of benefit, so there would be no need for a study using the medication before legalizing it.\nAnother issue with cannabis: Marijuana is a Schedule 2 Controlled Substance and it is illegal to sell, import, and produce. The government does not fund studies to answer whether marijuana can be good for patients. But the FDA says that its research guidelines are for medical purposes and they say that \"studies for health or pharmaceutical reasons\" would be acceptable.\nThere is little research on the use of CBD in adults, and most CBD products are sold under a strain of marijuana - and often this strain is THC-infused. Since cannabis is legal, a good thing. CBD isn't THC. THC is called Cannabidiol (CBD), because it's the chemical in the cannabis that causes the positive effects on health.\nAlthough the FDA and Congress have not done a full study of the effects of marijuana on the body, there is one study that does. It's called \"Effect of Cannabidiol on Heart Function\" - published in the May 2013 article in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. It reports findings about the \"cardiac effects\" of medical doses of marijuana. The study did not specifically ask if the effects of marijuana on the \"heart\" were due to CBD, or CBD's effect on reducing the inflammation in the heart, or a combination of both.\nThey report that marijuana increases heart function as effectively as or better than 90mg of placebo. They say that the results suggest positive effects from moderate and long-term marijuana use and suggest that these positive effects could be sustained even when cannabis is discontinued.\nThey suggest that people should be tested at least once on an annual basis and continue to use regular doses, and that people should take 3-5mg of THC and 1/3 mg of CBD every 12 to 24 hours, or until the 90% THC threshold, which is when they can become sick or addicted to THC.\nOther studies have been done on the effect of THC and CBD in animal experiments. They show that THC increases heart rate and breathing, and reduces blood pressure. They show that CBD does not have the same effect.\nThere are no clinical trials on the effects of CBD on cardiac and renal function, so the FDA considers that", "What NICE guidelines for CVD prevention would be suitable for John, given his profile - a 70-year-old Chinese man, with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, current smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and a family history of CVD? Does this mean that he's at high risk for CVD? What types of lifestyle interventions are appropriate for this individual?"], "6": ["John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\nNICE guidelines to guide the clinical decision making that will lead to the implementation of these guidelines, a series of interventions focused on primary prevention or reduced risk of CVD, will be required to control, minimise the risk of cardiovascular disease. It will also be needed to reduce heart-related deaths.\nAlthough many people are taking a Mediterranean Diet and not focusing on cholesterol reduction, the 8 main components of the Mediterranean Diet as presented above have shown benefit compared to other diets. It should be emphasised that even if people are following a Mediterranean Diet the diet has a large array of other benefits such as lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol, lower risk of stroke, diabetes and heart attacks. In 2012 NICE recommended 35 to 36 servings of fish per week and 2 cups of fruit, so it should be possible to have a Mediterranean Diet, as long as it is high in protein (130g of milk and 60g of meat) and a good range of whole food sources of both protein including nuts and seeds. The Mediterranean diet is a low fat diet and a relatively low fat diet. There are some other benefits such as higher intake of antioxidants like lutein and zeaxanthin which prevent the over generation of free radicals that leads to the development of CVD.\nThe Mediterranean Diet and cholesterol\nAlthough the 35g fish per week recommendation being set by NICE is high however, the Mediterranean diet can still play a significant role in the reduction of CVD risk and would be a valuable component for CVD prevention. In 2012 NICE showed that Mediterranean Diets can influence LDL and HDL cholesterol levels at 60g per week, as it was lower in triglycerides than at 90g. They are more effective in reducing the risk of heart attack, heart surgery, deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke. This important finding needs to be taken into account when determining where to aim and where to take steps to reduce CVD risk.\nNICE also recommended a Mediterranean Diet for patients with at least one of the aforementioned CVD risk factors, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, as a lifestyle intervention, to reduce CVD risk for people with these heart diseases.\nThe Mediterranean diet can also reduce risk of cardiovascular disease. This is supported by evidence from the Framingham Osteoporotic Study which showed that the Mediterranean diet was significantly associated with reduced risk of future cardiovascular events and death in subjects at risk of cardiovascular disease after controlling for confounding factors such as BMI.\nHigh blood pressure - High systolic: 130 mm Hg or more\nHigh systolic: 125 mm Hg or more\nHypertension - High diastolic: 95 mm Hg or more\nHypertension - High systolic: 120 mm Hg or more\nHypertension - High diastolic: 90 mm Hg or more\nIf you are prescribed a blood pressure test, a doctor should be aware, that an elevated blood pressure, for example, may indicate that a person has had a previous heart attack, heart surgery, high blood cholesterol and/or diabetes. This is due to the fact that in the context of the Mediterranean diet it is recommended to restrict or eliminate fats, saturated and trans fats, as the Mediterranean diet emphasises the high fat content and high unsaturated fat (including omega-3 fatty acids) in the Mediterranean Diet.\nIn 2012, NICE also said that although the guidelines for the reduction of CVD risk did provide good scope for other factors such as exercise and social support in determining the reduction of CVD such as:\n- The 35g fish per week recommendation to reduce the risk of CVD 60g is better than current recommendations for a Mediterranean Diet which is recommended to reduce the risk of future cardiovascular disease, if the 34g fish per week recommendation is higher because it doesn\u2019t apply to people taking statin drugs. It is also better to try to cut down alcohol intake at the same time as reducing salt intake (by the recommended 2.5 servings or 250ml of alcohol per week).\n- The Mediterranean diet is lower in trans fats and saturated fats than the recommendations in the NHS Guidelines by 3 to 4 years.\nThe Mediterranean diet is not a cure for all diseases but is a powerful element in reducing the risk of all forms of disease and may just be a major tool in the fight to keep it, if proven effective it will be an invaluable tool as a way of controlling and preventing the many diseases that are causing the many million premature deaths and disability each year.", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\n- This is a 62-year-old, a 35-year-old. A BMI of 55 - 126 is considered borderline in relation to hypertension and heart failure, a smoker, type 2 diabetes, a family history of CVD (which may suggest high blood pressure) is a key member in the family history or risk factor, having a medical history of heart attack 4 months or more prior to being referred to be seen for CVD, a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a key member of the health screening in the population.\nSo now the answer with the key items for high cholesterol and cardiovascular diseases:\n- a. Get it. The 75 mmol/l or higher is enough to put you at an increased risk of developing one of these conditions.\n- b. Eat it up. The American Heart Association recommends taking about 300 to 500 IU of vitamin E per day since vitamin E protects against the damaging effects of arachidonic acid on artery walls and cardiovascular function.\n- c. Get it. The American Heart Association recommends keeping HDL cholesterol levels within the normal range (35-40 mg/dl). This is particularly important for those at the risk of a developing plaque-causing blood clot (hypo-trichophorous arteriosclerosis).\n- d. Sleep well. The 10-year recommended amount of sleep for an average adult is 7-9 hours.\nSo I am very pleased with all of these recommendations.\nI have come across the following two new items:\n- What is the primary risk factor for developing high blood pressure in youth?\n- What can you do to prevent high blood pressure in children?\nThe first item that I am intrigued about is called \"parent-child relationships.\"\nIf you have a child with high blood pressure, you are more likely to have it yourself. There are a number of reasons why:\n- As discussed in the previous column, a 400 ml is more than enough for a 5.8 mm Hg rise in blood pressure for one year.\n- If the parents have asthma, the child is at risk for asthma.\n- Having diabetes and pre-diabetes are both risk factors for cardiovascular disease (high blood pressure)\nThe second important point is \"home environment.\"\nI have found that your home environment carries a major impact on your health. You are more likely to have an eating plan you don not adhere to, and a home environment that is unaffordable or unhealthful will predispose you to developing this illness. A study in 1999 of over 500,000 people found that those who had healthy homes were 68% less likely to have developed heart disease. Similarly, low income residents had 31% lower rates of diabetes than affluent residents. In other words, the more affordable a house is the lower your risk for chronic conditions.\nHow can you reduce your risk for high blood pressure? Well, a few actions are:\n- Eat healthy and reduce or cut down on saturated fat, which is a major component to excess cholesterol.\n- Avoid red meat. Be on the look out for processed meats, such as bacon and hot dogs, ham, sausages, and deli meats.\n- Reduce processed foods. Try to eat mostly whole grains and avoid white breads, cereals, white rice, white potatoes, and sweetened snack foods.\n- Regular exercise. The 4-hour workout regime described in the previous column is a great way to keep your body healthy. Even a simple walk of 30 minutes a day for a week will yield great health benefits.\nThis is all a reminder that everyone has the opportunity to be healthy; it is your responsibility to take care of what you have.\nDr. Schnur is on the Board of Directors of a high-performance health care provider that has trained hundreds of qualified physicians and developed excellent patient-centered care in over 100 centers.

What steps are to be taken to prevent type 2 diabetes?\nL.D. is a physician at NICE Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in London. It\u2019s a non-disclosure document that provides clear information.\n- Type 2 diabetes is a complex disorder whose development relies on complex interactions between genetic factors, lifestyle, genetics and the environment. It is strongly associated with diet and exercise; however, diet and exercise alone are not usually sufficient to prevent type 2 diabetes, as it is a multifactor disease (or disorder which can affect the person). It is believed that a single gene or gene, or combination of genes for a gene, can cause type 2 diabetes.\n- The disease, as well as obesity, is associated with increased inflammation. The inflammatory response leads to the loss of healthy cells in the pancreas and other organs, which leads to fat storage.\n- There is an increased risk of the onset of insulin resistance among type 2 diabetics. Type 2 diabetes, by definition, develops slowly and so people do not go out and eat more if their type 2 diabetes is left untreated.\nQ. What type of diabetes is not well known in clinical practice?\nP.K. was the diabetic from whom NICE began to develop the guidelines, and is a leading international research centre in type 2 diabetes research. He has been diagnosed as developing type 2 diabetes by NICE guidelines. P.K. is not well known in clinical practice because he did not have diabetes until about nine years after the initial diagnosis, so he is not in a clinical trial. NICE is taking its advice when it has data on P.K. and the development of type 2 diabetes.\nQ. What type of diabetes is being discussed in the world today?\nQ. When will the recommendations come down? Can we use the same numbers for everyone?\nL.D. is a patient at NICE Centre of disease Control and Prevention (UK). He and his research team had asked NICE to develop a guideline setting out the type 2 diabetes risk in people having a healthy lifestyle, and if there is a risk of type 2 diabetes, do so within five years. This guideline will be published within 20 years following approval by NICE. They can ask the public if they would want to be used within five years.\nQ. Can the development of new therapies be stopped?\nL.D., who was on the NICE Group on Cardiovascular Drugs.\n- Currently there are not any clear-cut guidelines for people who use a drug, which slows down their progression of their disease or reduces its effects, or even prevents the effects of their drug from returning.\n- A drug could stop a slow disease getting worse or prolonging the stage until then.\nQ. What is the current role of the NICE community in advocating for new medication recommendations? Can you provide an example of how this works today?\nL.D.\u2014The NICE Clinical Guidelines Framework\nAn international research programme coordinated by the NICE Council on Health Outcomes has developed a comprehensive national guideline setting for type 2 diabetes. This guideline will be published by November 2006.\n- This guideline sets out which drugs to give and what are the recommended treatment approaches.\n- The guideline applies generally to all patients, regardless of their diabetes status, including those who don\u2019t have diabetes.\n- It sets out guidelines on the use of drugs, alcohol and non-drug interventions.\n- The report is based on research and the best available evidence.\nQ. Is there a problem with the NICE guidelines?\nS.L. is a professor at the University of Leeds School of Medicine. He is the Chief Investigator of a trial to see if the latest NICE guidelines are effective reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in people who have other risk factors for diabetes.\nA study by the University of Leeds showed that people who were on the NICE guideline group had 17 percent less risk of developing type 2 diabetes than people on the NICE group without the guideline.\nQ. Does NICE recommend these medications to people whose diabetes is not controlled by diet and exercise?\nL.D., who is working in the Diabetes Trials Group at Cancer Research UK in London, and NICE, is a Professor at Imperial College London. In 2002 he showed that a reduction of 19 percent in a single-drug dose of insulin from 11 to 2 would lower the risk of diabetes of the", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be? How far would you go? What would be a good recommendation? Why?\nIn a previous discussion in the blog: what should the public health plan do for CVD?. Let us discuss how the public health team could advise such a group based on the NICE recommendations on CVD prevention.\nAt the moment the NICE guideline recommendations seem to be:\n1. The national health system has a responsibility for CVD prevention. In terms of implementation of the guideline policy the public health team should continue with the previous recommendation. However, should the national health system\u2019s role change in the following future years? I\u2019m not certain. What is the best future intervention for the public health team?\n2. As a public health team, our work does not end here. What is the current best intervention for the public health team?\n3. Although it is not the national health system\u2019s responsibility to adopt the new guideline recommendations, its responsibility is still the public health team. What else can the public health team do to help mitigate CVD risk?\nThe best result for the public health team would be to follow a new guideline of CVD prevention for a longer time and make other adjustments according to the guidance.", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\nA. The most important lifestyle recommendation is to maintain a moderate weight. One should aim for a BMI of 18.5 to 24.5. When you reach this weight your waist size will gradually shrink and your cholesterol profile will follow an elevated one, so that it will be very easy to be classified as \u2018normal\u2019 for CVD risk.\n- 2. The most important health-protective activity to do is improve your life style, i.e. eat more fruits, vegetables, fruits and vegetables are good for you; and drink alcohol only in moderation.\n- 3.

It is the easiest measure. If you are already in the heart area, you need to have a heart test at least once a year. You may still need to have a blood test for one and a half times.\nAs you are beginning to make changes, you will want to make sure that, if there is any side effects, such as any bleeding, kidney damage, stroke, heart irregularities, or other diseases, you may still have to take some medications.\nFor this, you can take steps: (1) you can take medication more regularly to regulate blood pressure; (2) reduce your smoking (i.e., avoid both smoking and quitting). With a low blood pressure level, 20/40 can keep you out of the hospital, especially for someone at high risk of dying from a heart attack.\nSo start now to prevent and reverse heart diseases.\nIf you want to know more, the cardiac expert at NICE will also discuss CVD prevention with you.\n\u00a9 Copyright 2018.

But that still will not be enough as I also work with patients, colleagues and patients' loved ones - to give them the help and encouragement they need to get on top of their health.\nSome people say that we don't actually have enough information to make clinical decisions if we don't know what to consider. What I think would be a fair question is whether a patient, an NHS health professional, or a patient with a general understanding of their health are willing to consider NICE guidance before he or she starts making lifestyle and intervention decisions.\nIf somebody is at risk of developing a CVD and would like to start a heart health programme, a person with a BMI > 30 is a risk patient, a person with a smoking history is smoking and a person who is obese who would like to begin a weight loss programme is also considered.\nSo as a GP, what is the first thing to consider when a patient or a family member has a heart attack?\nMy heart is about 50% of the way to 100% and that is just before I'm talking. In order for you to be able to understand their heart, we first have to find out what is the risk factor that needs to be managed to prevent, or treat, heart attacks.\nIf someone has a higher risk than 20% for a heart attack, they are at greater risk for developing a heart attack and we then need to know what level of lifestyle changes will help reduce this, as in our example above, the person has an above 30% at the same risk then they need to focus on eating a heart healthier way of life that helps to reduce heart risk.\nI do believe that if the patient is at high risk, or if the level of risk for cardiovascular disease should be quite high, there are some guidelines out there which can help identify a patient who would benefit from a higher level of lifestyle changes.\nOne such example I could introduce to the patient is a very high risk individual for hypertension. Hypertension is a measure of blood pressure, so if they have been through an intense cardiac event or with a high risk for a heart attack, this will put them at a much higher level of risk for any cardiovascular incident.\nOnce we have taken the patient into consideration, what will that also mean that I have to do or how can we apply NICE guidelines?\nIn order for a patient to decide to start or continue any intervention, we have to determine how the patient compares to other patients in whom that intervention would probably be beneficial in the future.\nIf their risk of developing some of this health condition goes down, we would then be able to suggest a plan to improve or reduce these risk factors.\nWhat would be considered as an acceptable level of lifestyle change?\nSo we would give them a list of lifestyle interventions that the plan can include that would be effective with a moderate impact, which is a recommended level of lifestyle change that may involve changes in lifestyle.\nSo what would the plan look like on this list?\nThe plan could include changes in diet, activity levels, a lifestyle focus on eating a heart healthier way of life and it would need to be supported by appropriate referrals.\nThere are a number of other lifestyle interventions, for instance, physical activity and diet will likely require additional appointments and referrals, so again, this is an ongoing process, because a specific intervention will take time to work and it may need some ongoing follow-up to see how well it works.\nThere are still questions that go in with some interventions that the NICE guidance doesn't cover, such as what is called weight loss or weight maintenance. So this is an area where there is discussion with staff about how any intervention that is recommended will be supported by a plan, whether an annual or bi-annual visit is to recommend such a plan.\nThese health professionals need to be aware of their roles and responsibilities under NICE guidelines. If you are a GP, a specialist nurse or patient who are concerned about high risk individuals for cardiovascular disease, then they need to have their own network of networks of colleagues and support who will help to advise them on how to do something", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\nNICE guidelines define a number of conditions that can be \u2018preventative\u2019 or \u2018protective\u2019 of CVD, and these are described below. 25 different CVD conditions can be \u2018preventative\u2019 even in the most common cardiovascular disease in the world, i.e. high bad cholesterol, high blood pressure and insulin resistance. As a result some people with these heart conditions can dramatically lower their risk of dying from stroke or heart attack. Although an individual\u2019s personal experience may not always match up with the results of these guidelines, this doesn\u2019t stop people from taking action.\nWhat exactly is the Framingham Framingham risk score (FRS)?\nThis scale was developed by the Framingham Research Foundation to classify risk scores for cardiovascular deaths. The first FRS described a person\u2019s risk of dying within 1 year after their first birthday, using information from data from 38,513 males born in 1948 to 1948 from Framingham, Massachusetts, USA. These data are from almost 100,000 people before 1998.\nThe FRS uses two key variables to predict CVD risk that can be used independently to describe risk for a person. The first is the waist measurement, which helps classify people based on their \u2018waist circumference\u2019.\nThe second variable is cholesterol: a measure of a person\u2019s \u2018bad\u2019 cholesterol. The FRS uses a score of 0 to 100 for LDL cholesterol, with 100 being borderline and 0 being perfectly healthy, and with a total cholesterol of less than 200 and an HDL cholesterol score below 40. Individuals without elevated risk scores and with a normal cholesterol and blood pressure are considered to be \u2018normal\u2019.\nWho is in the UK?\nThe NHS will use all the research into the effects of these FRSs, and these results are published in the NHS\u2019s \u2018The Quality and Outcomes of Care Report\u2019 26. However, this has not been done for the 79 million people in the EU. The FRS is used only by the NHS to assess the efficacy of public health initiatives on lowering CVD risk and for evaluating the effectiveness of CVD treatments.\nThe NHS doesn\u2019t directly use these FRSs in its \u2018guidance on CVD prevention\u2019, rather, it uses other data to assess their effectiveness in its \u2018Prevent\u2019 initiative, the largest UK-wide survey of people\u2019s cardiovascular health. People with a low risk of CVD who are in the survey receive additional guidance. This means people are more likely to do the research needed to change how they live their lives, to help reduce CVD risk, including by using different lifestyle strategies, such as weight loss and exercise, and by taking other risk reductions, such as not smoking and reducing alcohol consumption.\nMore about the research is available here.\nThe 47 million NHS people don\u2019t have a set of CVD-related guidelines in practice. What should follow if there are no CVD guidelines in place?\nWhat we need to be clear about is that the aim of any CVD-related guidelines is to change the way the public is treated for CVD, and not restrict people from doing things which are very important to them.\nThis means not just treating CVD using traditional, prescribed medical measures, but also improving their lives not only through prevention but through their own decision-making.

The aim is to improve lives in the general population, including to lower the burden of CVD.\nIn addition, decision-makers and people themselves are a vital part of the risk-reducing community, and so the NHS has a special role to play in identifying, implementing and monitoring people\u2019s progress towards implementing the key objectives in its \u2018Prevent\u2019 program.\nThe NHS already makes a difference in many ways, but it is important not to forget that people also have a choice.

The group of patients with a blood pressure of 169/101 mmHg is likely for a non-diabetic who had never had a heart attack or stroke, a high BMI, or a history of smoking. In the group of patients with a range of medical conditions, such as diabetes that have no known risk factors, the group of patients is likely for a patient with a family history of CVD or a history of smoking. The groups for which more study could be done are for patients with a history of smoking, the group of patients with a history of a history of a CHD, CVD, etc.\nFor patients with a family history of CVD or a history of smoking, the group would be 50 years-old from a smoking history. For patients who have a family history of CHD, the group could be 50 years-old from a smoking or hypertension history. For the low-density lipoprotein group, the group could be 40 years-old from a smoking history.\nThe recommended group of patients for a heart scan in the low-density lipoprotein group for the group from patients with a history of cigarette smoking is 50 years-old from a smoking history. Based on the guideline, 60 years-old from a smoking history would be included in the group for the first group. For the non-smoking group, based on the guideline, the group would be 60 years-old at least from the same history of a smoking and a positive blood pressure, including a 125m/lead smoking history would also be included for the group of non-smoking patients. Based on the guideline, 60 years-old from smoking would be included in the group for the first group. A smoking history greater than or less than the current smoker is considered to be a new smoking history.\nBased on the findings, a group of non-smoking patients would be given the following guidelines:\nFor patients with a smoking history and a healthy lifestyle and for patients with a history of smoking, based on NICE guidelines, the group would be 50 years-old from a smoking history. Based on the guidelines, the lower limit of normal for the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) should be 40 mmol/L (norm. 63), the upper limit is 103 mmol/L (norm. 120) for high-density lipoprotein (HDL), based on the level of HDL levels would be lower and would be 45 mmol/L (122) for the group. Based on the background of the group, the number should be increased, according to the current guideline, but the current and high-density levels should be included in the group for that patient with a history of tobacco smoking or a history of CHD. Based on NICE guidelines, the lower limit for risk for low-density lipoprotein is 83, with a high of 98, and the lower limit for risk for the high-density lipoprotein is 99, for a patient history of smoking. Based on current guidelines, the group should have a lower limit (HDL/HDL) of 115 mmol/L (185), with a risk of 150 for people who smoke, and a high risk for high-density lipoprotein between 110 and 120 for those who do not smoke. Based on the levels in the blood, the group and the guidelines are 60 years-old from a smoking history, based on the guideline, the group would be 60 years-old from a smoking history.

Eat whole-grain, plant-based foods \u2013 A diet with a very high consumption of fibre (from vegetables, fruit, whole wheat and oats) reduces your risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.\n2. Lose weight \u2013 It is estimated that around 35% of global CVD and heart disease deaths could be prevented by achieving and maintaining a healthy BMI, and reducing waist circumference by 20 kg (40 lbs).\n3. Reduce saturated fat intake \u2013 A Mediterranean-type diet with a reduced consumption of red meat, fish and dairy can significantly reduce cholesterol levels and the risk of CVD heart disease.\n4. Increase intake of unsaturated fat (mainly from olive, canola, sunflower, rapeseed and nuts).\n5. Increase physical activity \u2013 Exercise will have a positive effect on several risk factors including high blood pressure, cholesterol levels, blood fat levels, and risk of cardiovascular diseases.\n6. Avoid eating fast food \u2013 Fast food in general, also known as processed and junk food is a rich source of sodium, calories from fat, carbohydrates, added sugar, artificial additives and preservatives. This type of food is very convenient.\n7. Reduce intake of trans fats.\nHealth benefits of NICE guidelines include reducing the risk of CVD and reducing the risk of strokes, diabetes and cancer, and improving the quality of life.\nWhat about cardiovascular disease prevention guidelines from NICE:\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has published guidelines that provide specific evidence-based advice to health professionals on how individuals should be educated on heart-healthy lifestyles.\nThe new guidelines outline specific lifestyle changes that are recommended, as well as strategies and practices to incorporate in the work-up of people with risk factors for CVD.\nThese guidelines also recognise that there are other people who are at risk of adverse long term health implications of cardiovascular disease and health promotion practices should be tailored to the individual or family when designing health care programmes for each person. It is essential that health professionals identify their own personal and family risk factors, understanding how to modify these and reduce their likelihood of adverse health outcomes.\nHealth promotion is a multi-disciplinary process used to influence individual behaviours and decisions and enhance the quality of life. The five-step program can improve the quality of life and lifestyle choices of individuals with high risk for cardiovascular diseases, stroke, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cancer and dementia. It can also help reduce the risk of mortality.\nYou can visit", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?

Smoking is a leading driver of CVD, so you can ask, \"What are the key lifestyle factors, are you smoking a lot and want to quit?\" Well, one study looked at 10,646 patients from Britain and found that those smokers were more likely to have a heart attack and died compared to those who stopped smoking. In contrast, those who smokes a little were less affected; they were simply less likely to die.\nWhat about people like I,2? Many people have a family history of CVD, and those who have had heart disease have a 20% poorer prognosis than those who have never had a heart attack, that is, have no family history of diabetes, not smoking in general, don't have a smoking history, have a history of coronary heart (coronary), and the person usually feels well when the stroke or heart attack comes. So it is a bit of a grey area in terms of what we could actually do to help people.\nSo what do you suggest? I might ask you, \"What are the key lifestyle factors, are you smoking a lot and want to quit?\" Well, you don't know, so for example, we did a study with 567 men who were known as the cohort A and were smokers and had a higher smoking history (10,646 versus 54,557). The mortality was pretty good (310 of 400 vs 230).\nOn the other hand, you don't know what we can do, so we might suggest a more focused program, a little intervention. We would have to work with that patient and educate him in terms of diet, exercise and other personal management strategies such a cessation of smoking, stress reduction strategies, the diet/lifestyle, some diet, exercise and some management of alcohol use among others.\nWe can also provide information about the medications that they have been prescribed to reduce the risks of CVDs.\nYou see, one of the things we are worried about is people with high cholesterol in general. So what we do on a year-to-year basis for this patient, we're concerned about how low their cholesterol is because he's a 49-year-old African-American man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.6, and high LDL cholesterol levels of 111. It was a risk factor for hypertension, which is a risk factor for CVD. We need to talk about it, so we address it.\nWhat can we suggest? We're going to talk about the medications like statins, which these are new types of drugs, but again, we're trying to educate them about cardiovascular issues. But we also take patient progress, including the fact that this patient was taking statins, if they weren't taking them, if they were taking them too little, and they were taking them because they thought they had lower risk of heart attack.\nBut we also ask questions about the medications that this patient is taking. Does this patient have high cholesterol? Does he have high triglyceride levels? Can he have the best treatment, or can he have this side effect, such as this patient, who had a stroke but he had a better treatment in the other part of his life with another type of treatment?\nWell, we might suggest a different therapy that may be associated with these results. For example, it could be if he had a heart attack, so he could need additional treatment to prevent some of the heart attacks. Or he could do a very long day at work, could do a lot of the activity, maybe do some exercise, which may improve symptoms of CVD.\nThis patient, he's now 61. Is it going to improve his CVD risk? Maybe, but he is still going to miss jobs or he'll have a lower income because of his cholesterol, and he has a stroke, can improve his risk by being in a lifestyle where he would have gotten an exercise program like the one prescribed for a person with high cholesterol.\nAre we asking questions? Well, I think our patients, a lot of patients, when they're about 50 years old, some of them may have low LDL cholesterol, and some a lot more, but at what point do they think that low cholesterol is high risk? So we're not asking for this patient's opinion, but to let them know that if there is", "John, a 70-year-old Chinese man with a BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a smoker, non-diabetic with a family history of CVD, needs a set of CVD prevention recommendations based on NICE guidelines, what would they be?\nThe above is a description of how well a person is able to keep their weight in a healthy range for their height in the UK.\nIf they are underweight or obese, they need an appropriate treatment program to reverse the disease and maintain normal cardiovascular and metabolic health.\nThe American Heart Association recommends lifestyle interventions such as a diet and exercise program, along with blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar monitoring regularly. Smoking cessation programs also should be part of the program.\nTreatment by lifestyle change should first be based on an assessment by the patient to identify the severity of the disease. If the patient already have a disease, treatment is limited to treating the symptom rather than the underlying cause.\nThe National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute also recommends to do a cardiovascular risk assessment of the patient's risk of CVD for certain groups of individuals.\nFor smokers or people with a family history of CVD, a plan to quit smoking is a crucial part of treatment, however for those with a family history of CVD, it is important for them to continue to be abstainers and restrict the intake of saturated fats and sodium.\nThe guidelines should be followed with a tailored treatment programme and lifestyle changes.\n- National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (2003).

Due to a shortage of resources and heavy industrial pollution, many people in China have developed a wide variety of cardiovascular diseases over the years. Due to various factors, it is said that cardiovascular disease accounts for the majority of deaths in China and is the cause of around 30 % of people dying prematurely. Despite the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, Chinese people are not aware of any risk factors for heart disease. The NICE guidelines are a source of information. The NICE guidelines are for:\n- Reducing one\u2019s blood pressure to reduce the risk of CVD,\n- Managing a lifestyle with lower-fat/saturated fats, and\n- Managing high triglycerides to reduce stroke/heart attacks. This approach focuses on reducing the risk of CVD as well as lowering blood pressure.\nThe aim is to promote healthy lifestyles. It\u2019s a positive role model: all of you will know what you should be. The NICE guideline makes an overall recommendation of 50 % (0.5 * BMI * LDL cholesterol) reduction \u2013 which translates into an overall lower BMI: the BMI of the person is calculated from the BMI for their height and weight and a 14 kg person would need to lower a BMI by 55 kg. The number 50 is the maximum possible reduction. It is the most important weight reduction recommendation of the guideline.\n*It is not recommended to eat fish because fish contains high levels of saturated fats.\n**The goal is to get your blood pressure and lipid levels, both below 140/90 mmHg on a BP screening scale, in accordance with the NICE guidance and above 140/90 mmHg on a normal blood pressure screening scale.\nAnswer 7: My name is David, I\u2019ve been in the business for nearly 14 years.

The NICE recommendation has changed for the second time, following review of evidence, making this clear.\n13B) When people are encouraged to make these changes, we are at a point in time where they are increasing their chance of survival from CVD, we want to make sure that we also increase the chance of survival from all causes.\nWhat should the aim be of a national programme for the control of cardiovascular (cardio)-related diseases?\nThe aim of the national programme for the control of cardiovascular (cardi-related) diseases is a reduction in the risk of all causes of death.\nAn explanation of the objective is available in NICE guidelines, 2018 to 2020. The target of these guidelines is 50% reduction in risk of all causes of death for people. NICE also recommends a reduction in CVD risk in this age group. A possible limitation is that NICE has not put in place national programme for the control of CVD in young adults but, there is a target to reduce the risk even in this age group.\nTherefore, although NICE guidelines provide a clear link between primary outcomes and secondary outcomes, the NICE guidelines do not say that there is an objective objective target for the reduction in mortality.\nIn another document, another section of NICE guideline 2019 has the term \u2018outcome\u2019 in a narrower meaning as to what to measure, as there is no objective objective target.\nFurther, the term \u2018outcome\u2019 is not used in the NICE guidelines of 2020. These are a further indication that NICE\u2019s definition of outcome may not be consistent with the NICE guidelines.\nIn the case of CVD, NICE guideline 2019 is more specific. We know that CVD causes mortality. Therefore, it is very clear from the NICE guidelines. In the 2020 guideline, the term \u2018outcome in terms of mortality\u2019 is not defined. Thus, we cannot take the definition into account in the NICE guidelines.\nIn this document there are four sections:\n1) What are the aims?\n2) What do we aim to do?\n3) What are the consequences for the member of the NHS?\n4) What are the benefits for the Member of the NHS?", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?\n(a) Lifestyle modification measures\n(b) Drug-based medications\n(c) Non-drug interventions\n(d) All those\nDates: 12 April 2016 \u2013 18 March 2017\nMedDay: 02 June 2016\nThe Government has called 28 June to 26 July for the setting of guidelines on nutrition (not cholesterol) and health behaviours (not smoking) for preventing CVD and related diseases in Scotland.\nThis is the first time that Health Services is proposing that national guidelines be published, and is in line with the new National Health Service (NHS) guidance on public health.

The goal of anti-coronary heart disease is to lower the risk of heart attacks without causing side effects, such as lung cancer and pulmonary embolisms. Therefore, it is important to achieve both goals. The American Heart Association (AHA) defines and promotes three goals:\n- To prevent heart disease.\n- Prevent heart disease, including stroke.\n- Prevent heart and circulatory diseases.\nSmoking cessation must be followed by regular medication-based treatment. If there is a history of coronary artery disease, there is a higher risk of this risk. Cardiovascular drugs should be changed if the person meets the criteria for smoking cessation. The following are prescribed by the AHA and the American Heart Association (AHA):\n- Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT):\n- Nicotine patch: NRT is given as the lower dose and nicotine is replaced.\n- Nicorette: Nicotine delivery is nicotine delivered to the lungs from gum or spray\n- Nicorix: The only FDA-approved nicotine product with 78% nicotine delivery, it can be used with the drug, Nicorix\n- Nicorix plus varenicline: Nicorix plus varenicline improves smoking cessation\n- Smokers who are taking high doses varenicline or Nicorix plus varenicline, they can also see an improvement in smoking cessation.\n- Nicorix plus varenicline (NRT-VAR) or nicotine patch: Varenicline is provided by the same company as nicotine patch, it is a safer medicine with similar effects as varenicline.\n- Nicorix plus varenicline or nicotine patch plus bupropion: Nicorix plus bupropion decreases cigarette cravings and nicotine withdrawal by increasing nicotine delivery.\n- Nicorette: It is a prescription medicine given by the doctor. Nicorette has fewer side effects than other nicotine products.\n- Nicorix plus varenicline. It is a prescription medicine given as IV injection. It can be used for people with severe cardiovascular disease. It is administered in 100 mg of a lower dose plus varenicline for at least 12 months.\n- Smokers without coronary heart disease who have smoked at least 30 cigarettes a day for their lifetime. It can be used over a further decade for about 8 or 10 months.\n- If the person is on cardiac medications (chemo), they usually need to stop smoking. The most common nicotine patch has fewer side effects.\n- For people with chronic kidney disease, it is recommended to stop taking the following medications:\n- Sotalol, a medication that blocks the activity of ACE (angiotensin receptor, a heart muscle stimulant).\n- Betalal, an anti-inflammatory, relaxant, relaxant, and antiemetic drugs\nWhat smoking cessation and treatment approaches are available from the AHA, the American Heart Association, and the American College of Cardiology?\n- Nicorette: It can be a prescription drug from the same company as varenicline and nicotine patch. It can also be purchased as a generic drug from Zocor. It also has fewer side effects.\n- Nicorix plus varenicline. According to the USNHS, Nicorix plus varenicline or nicotine patch has the smallest number of adverse events. When combined with varenicline or varenicline, natures, along with other medications, is best.\n- Nicorette plus bupropion. Nicorette plus bupropion is taken by mouth and also an injection. Nicorette plus bupropion can be used without the need for a prescription or a doctor's call. The number of adverse events is higher than Nicorix plus varenicline.\n- Nicorix plus varenicline. Nicorix plus varenicline has fewer side effects than nicotine patches.\n- Nicorix plus Bupropion. Nicorix plus Bupropion is a pill used to treat many conditions (such as Parkinson's disease, stroke, and congestive heart failure) that may include heart failure.\nAHA recommends that people have a \"healthy lifestyle,\" including lifestyle changes and tobacco and nicotine cessation, to avoid the risk associated with smoking. People can prevent future health issues by quitting smoking during high-risk periods.\nWhat is the best medicine for the", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?

It is an important factor in the development of heart disease, the major cause of morbidity and mortality, and stroke.\nMetabolic syndrome is also an important component of the metabolic syndrome (also called polyendocrine syndrome) in which many other diseases (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia or dyslipidaemia) are noted as well as an important part of the familial tendency to type 2 diabetes, renal or cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.\nMany of the features associated with metabolic syndrome, such as abnormal lipid measurements, a predisposition to hypertension and diabetes, and increased visceral fat deposition, occur in women. In many studies, such as the National Institutes of Health sponsored Nurses' Health Study of 1988-1992 and the Nurses Health Studies, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is slightly lower among women than among men.\nThere are many possible causes of metabolic syndrome which are under study, not least of which is the presence of a genetic predisposition. The metabolic syndrome (or syndrome X) is thought to be triggered by an abnormal fat mass or the abnormal way fat is turned onto muscle. This causes too little protein in the diet and a reduction in the amount of physical activity.\nThere is also some suggestion that the increased level of insulin in humans and primates (in mice) causes this syndrome to develop, although it is unclear how the two factors, high levels of insulin induced by overweight humans, and high insulin production by body fat, contribute in any way.\nA group of factors which are strongly associated with the onset of metabolic syndrome.

This makes it more likely that a person's heart disease risk will decrease with a change to their individual lifestyle. The likelihood of these individuals following the guidelines is increased in populations under-resourced, such as inner-city or resource-limited populations. For example, China, Hong Kong, and Macau have an exceptionally high burden of cardiovascular disease in comparison with many other high-income countries. There is a need to understand which health conditions are at high risk, and to provide the best service possible to each population at the level in which healthcare delivery is most likely to succeed. It is likely that the government will develop a special programme to provide these individuals with advice on reducing their risk of heart disease \u2013 however, this initiative will need to be developed and fully-funded, and would require the active involvement of government and other stakeholders.\n\nCharter effect: When more people take part in an educational program, there is a greater chance of a change in the individual's behaviour. This means that the individual could be motivated to reduce their health risk, even if they lack the education they require to do so. For example, many individuals who have not completed a formal lifestyle-enhancement programme have adopted lifestyles such as not smoking, eating healthy, exercising regularly, and not drinking alcohol (BBC News, 2008; BBC News). If the government implemented the programme, it could produce the desired results. Although the programme requires government funding, it would be important to ensure that the programme is well-funded and that it is easily accessible to the public, thereby improving the likelihood that the programme will succeed.\n\nVarying and systematic risks: There are many health conditions which may have multiple, systematic risks. For example, a person with diabetes at high risk for CVD is likely to have higher levels of blood pressure, and less consumption of carbohydrates than some of their closest friends who do not have diabetes. They also likely to be more sedentary and less physically active than their counterparts who do not have diabetes. They may also be more likely to be obese (BMI > 30) at high risk and to be non-smokers. This increases the likelihood of other outcomes such as heart disease, osteoporosis, and diabetes, and the chance that CVD will develop to a much greater degree than if the person had not yet achieved the systematic risks of these conditions.\n\nThe central idea behind the VVSSG is that the systematic risks of many conditions such as CVD, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, obesity, or smoking need to be analysed by combining risk factors in order to develop target targets, which should be communicated to individuals, and public health policies developed. The programme will also aim to influence health behaviour change, which may include various forms of behaviour modification, e.g. providing a reduction in physical activity, reducing intake of unhealthy food, and minimising consumption of unhealthy beverages.\n\nVVSSG and the VVSSG will be implemented in Chinese people around the country, and in Hong Kong and Macau people. The programme will consist of three types of research:\n\n1. An administrative database will be developed that will allow the study of both primary and secondary outcomes (risk factors) to be identified. This database will provide an accurate and valuable information about people's heart disease risk for each person in each country. This database will enable the government to develop a unique programme that will be targeted to them in terms of healthcare delivery. This particular database to be developed will address multiple systemic risks by combining the 3 levels that were considered above \u2013 different levels within a country as well as globally. The aim of the database is to ensure that a person gets the right level of healthcare they require within their country, and not more. The research will be done by the WHO team. In addition, various government bodies will be selected from across the world and will be selected to develop this database. The programme will also include key stakeholders to ensure that the data obtained is accurate and up-to-date. This will enable the programme to achieve high-quality results, especially in terms of a better understanding of CVD risk in different areas of China and Hong Kong.\n2. Primary outcomes will be collected to help in developing strategies to be developed against CVD in selected countries. They will focus on individual risk factors (i.e. those associated with individual health outcomes) and risk factors within households (i.e. those associated with household-level risk", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?

[see details in part 2.b]\nA person with no family history of cardiovascular disease, no diabetes, a family history of CVD, no smoking, and no previous cardiovascular events should follow a fasting diet that includes 1.5 times of low fat dietary fat, 2.5 times of fruits and vegetables, and 4.5 times of whole grains, and exercise at least 3 times per week. Such foods should come from animal sources, and their intake must not exceed 1g/kg/day. If a person is overweight or obese, the dietary intake should be adjusted to 1.5g/kg/day. There are two tests: the fasting free cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, which can be performed with lipid panel. The best test is to do a lipid panel. [please note that a lipid panel is the best test to diagnose diabetes and cardiovascular disease than an exercise panel and that cholesterol is the best test to diagnose high blood sugar, and the best test to diagnose high blood pressure].\nAs stated above. The results of the testing can be used to determine whether the person has been subjected to the harmful effects of coronary heart disease, which can be used to diagnose whether the patient has been subjected to diabetes, and whether the patient has been subjected to a very high body fat content. After the person has gone through this intervention, he or she needs to change the diet according to the advice of the consultant doctor to see whether there is someone there who can help to modify the person's diet according to the information received from the doctor.\nIf your cholesterol does not drop below 112 mg/dL in the interval of one month, then you can make changes to your diet for this person who has been subjected to the harmful effects of atherosclerosis.\nMy cholesterol is 109 mg/dL, and it falls very well with the advice of the consulting doctor.

You can then use the NICE guidelines for CVD risk for a reasonable interval of time from the date of your first measurement (the period you need to test at for the risk of CVD to develop) to the date you start testing the following years to determine when your baseline risk for CVD is.\nThe second step is to determine the time of the time you decide to test. The NICE guidance shows that the amount of time you will need to test from the date of the time you determine the baseline risk is about 1 year.\nFor the case of a very clear clinical picture, it would be advisable to have tests at 50 years of age, 70 years, or before the age of 70 years if you have ever had a heart attack.\nFor the case where you have a relatively rare but more persistent episode that is diagnosed as coronary artery disease, the guidelines suggest that it takes three years after screening for either heart attack or angina to get to the target level of high blood pressure to achieve the target for risk of CVD.\nIf you are at high risk of having a future acute heart attack or angina but are not known to be clinically symptomatic or at risk have a patient who has a chronic angina/brucellosis or chronic heart block without presenting evidence of coronary artery disease, you can postpone having testing for cardiovascular risk until after your assessment of your patient's baseline risk.", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?\nYou do not have permission to access your email address in the following ways:\n- Please login using your email address by clicking on the link below, you will not be able to see your email address unless you click on the link for a confirmation via email.\n- Please use the password which is on the link.\n- This is a secure website.

What are the main targets of CVD interventions? What interventions should be integrated?\nA. There are 7 major targets for CVD that a healthcare professional can set as health professionals have no influence, but if a professional can set the target for their own care, then they can be as successful as possible in achieving their goals. The main targets for CVD are as follows:\n1) The highest risk group are those people with a BMI of 30 and/or high LDL-C (2.5), and people with a previous cardiovascular diagnosis of 1 to 3 years; a healthy lifestyle; a well-rested lifestyle, with no smoking; a healthy diet and weight loss.\n2) These individuals have 2 NICE guidelines, CVD prevention (3,4) and CVD risk, to help reduce or control these risk factors. CHD is the biggest risk factor for CVD and the main indicator of CVD mortality.\n3) A CVD prevention programme in the NHS is the main primary prevention strategy of CVD. Targets on these 3 measures will be implemented and assessed in the 2010 ACC/AHA Task Force Report (Task Force 2010). There can be other targets from those 3 strategies with lower likelihood of success. Targets must be as low but with high confidence.\n4) A CVD risk programme (3,4) has a specific target of 30 point-wise improvement over 2 years. Targets need to be as high as possible to allow change and improvement in risk behaviours (diet, exercise and weight control).\n5) A good lifestyle advice programme for people who have a CVD risk (diet, alcohol or exercise, for example) would have a target of at least 9 points to improve risk. Targets can be either low or high for a variety of reasons, (for example, having an exercise programme in the past (4,5), lifestyle changes in the past (6) or healthy habits (7).\n6) The most common type of evidence suggests that a CVD risk improvement programme should be as high as 2 or 3 points to achieve a high effect. The best results can also be achieved as the result of 2 points reduction (6).\n7) In support of the recommendations of IADRC, there is substantial body of evidence that, with very high support (and possibly an increase in awareness), people can achieve their goals within 2 years of initiation (8). This includes people with a BMI of 30 (10), who have one or more NICE guidelines and those with a history of CVD (11,12,13), and those with a previous stroke (14,15).\n8) Targeted care of CVD should be based on evidence that there is a 20% reduction in risk for some 24 days to 10 hours of follow-up and 25% drop of risk-taking behaviours.\n9) The 2010 Task Force report made recommendations for a CVD prevention programme based on a range of evidence (16). In a study of UK adults with metabolic syndrome (17), those who had a BMI of 30 and/or a history of CVD (2.5) had a 36% lower risk of CVD. The UK Heart Foundation's Life\u2019s Simple 8 (18) found that, for those who have a high BMI (32 \u2013 34 gm) and/or who have the highest cholesterol (above 2.3 mmol/L) and have a high blood pressure (above 10 mmHg), they can achieve 12 points in the Prevention Program for CVD prevention and 2 points in the Prevention Program for a Stroke Prevention programme. (The prevention (Prevention) package in the NHS programme is an example of a 20% reduction in risk of CVD.\n10) The National Strategy for Healthy Communities and Health (2011-2020) has 10 target groups:\n\u2022 Control of obesity/smoking\n\u2022 Regular physical activity, even if you are sedentary\n\u2022 Balanced diet\n\u2022 A healthy lifestyle\n\u2022 Mental health services and substance use services\n\u2022 Adequate income for housing, food and health.\n\u2022 Good self-esteem\n11) Some resources have been released about the benefits of NICE guidelines and guidance (9,20), and support for the introduction of CVD prevention programmes.\n12) A major public health study, NICE-", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?", "Given John's health data: 70 years old, Chinese, BMI of 30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?\nIn this case, there are no meaningful diagnostic criteria and the risk is very unknown (because the above-mentioned information is not recorded). The available data do not enable us to draw a simple prognosis but we can note that a 4-hour heart rate of 86 beats per minute (measured within one minute before the onset of heartbeats) and a systolic (LBP) of 90 mmHg (within two minutes) are not appropriate in such a clinical situation (see Figure below).\nFigure 7.

The three main types of lifestyle-related CVDs are lifestyle-related coronary heart disease; lifestyle-related hypertension; and lifestyle-related peripheral vascular disease. CVDs are diagnosed when a person has two of the following conditions in the absence of other risk factors or other medical conditions. There is no evidence of a relationship between the presence of these conditions and the development of CVD.\nHowever, if the person has three or more of these conditions, there may be a greater risk of CVD than if only one of the conditions is present. For example, high levels of total cholesterol, high blood pressure, and a family history of heart disease may increase the risk of CVD when someone also has low levels of HDL ('good') cholesterol. In contrast, lifestyle-related CVDs are more likely to be diagnosed when someone has two or more of these conditions.\nThe main cardiovascular management guidelines for CVD risk management in Australia or New Zealand are the following:\n- Age >30 years, and\n- Tobacco smoking or dependence (as measured by the National Intensive Tobacco-Free Lifetime Excludes) 30 years for women and 30 years for men, for males 40 years, and for females 40 years\n- Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.\nOther CVDs known to have a relationship with smoking include atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, and peripheral artery disease or atherosclerosis from diabetes, obesity, renal disease, renal failure/hepatocolysis, or renal failure, with a family history of CVD, or to a history of smoking with a family history of cardiovascular disease. The following conditions have been identified as an independent predictor of CVD: high blood pressure, cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and smoking cessation. This is one of the reasons why the American Heart Association has recommended that people under 30 be screened for high blood pressure, diabetes for more than 3 years, and smoking cessation for at least a year.\nThis is also the reason the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the part of the health service that manages high-risk patients to a certain point. NICE's role is to examine lifestyle-related CVDs and to suggest treatment and advice to help prevent or lower the incidence of CVD.\n- Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.\n- Atherogenic vascular disease.\n- Diabetes and kidney disease.\nA previous version of this advice was posted in the May/June 2018 edition of our blog.

30, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, total cholesterol of 6.7 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L, a current smoker, no diabetes, and a family history of CVD, what are the relevant NICE guidelines for CVD risk management?\n(480) The NICE guideline recommends:\n- Management of blood pressure to the recommended 130/80 mm Hg on the basis of the National Health and Nutrition Study in 1994.\n- Management of blood pressure to the recommended 30/70 mm Hg on the basis of the National Health and Family Survey in 1985.\n- An estimated 55/40 percentage points reduction in the risk of incident heart disease within 3 years after initiation of lifestyle change, compared with a 35 percent decrease if individuals followed a typical Mediterranean diet in 1994, without adjusting for socioeconomic factors.\nWhat is a risk factor, and how is it classified by the cardiovascular risk assessment tool (CRAFT) tool?\n(481) The CRAFT tool divides risk levels into 5 categories:\n- No or low-risk: Less than 40% of individuals meet a CRAFT score.\n- Low-risk: Risk of incident heart disease of 30 percent or more from the baseline population estimated baseline health profile.\nThe CRAFT tool allows the determination of an individual's risk level in two ways.\n- A medical assessment.\n- A clinical assessment.\nA medical assessment involves reviewing the medical history of the individual and discussing these factors if a person thinks a risk level is likely to be acceptable.\nA clinical assessment, sometimes called a diagnostic evaluation, asks a patient if he or she meets or exceeds a specific set of recommended medical screening criteria, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics standard.\nThe purpose of this step is to identify the type of risk and to identify the key factors contributing to the risk.\n- When considering risk, individuals need a detailed information about their health situation, including:\n- Prior treatment of major disease\n- Previous treatment for risk factors common to the patient\n- Family history of heart disease and stroke\n- Physical characteristics that do not make an individual risk.\n- A patient should ask multiple questions:\n- The reason for the assessment.\n- Whether it will have a significant impact on future treatment decisions.\n- About the risks and benefits.\n- Are there any limitations to the analysis?\nFor the CRAFT tool (also known as the CECF) use the tool in order to complete the steps:\n- You must obtain written consent from the patient to have the data submitted.\n- Information obtained will be reviewed and used to provide a baseline measure of cardiometabolic risk.\n- The assessment will be followed only after a detailed discussion, informed consent, and detailed review of the results.\n- The results of the assessment will be interpreted by a CRAFT expert and a third party professional.\n- The results are not included in the medical diagnosis.\n- After making decisions about how to manage risk factors, a case presentation/advisory will be reported.\n- The results of the assessment will also be considered when making final recommendations for how to manage risk factors.\nWhat is the current recommendation for diabetes and risk-related health care?\nThe CRAFT risk assessment tool is updated weekly with the latest findings from CCRF.\nWhat other measures are recommended to help prevent or slow the progression to CVD risk?\nThe most effective approaches to CVD risk management include exercise, healthy nutrition, limiting stress, minimizing smoking in combination with medication, smoking cessation and physical activity.\nWho should use these recommendations?\nIn the context of CCRF and CRAFT, the following individuals are recommended to make treatment decisions together with their cardiometabolic health professional:\n- If either patient lives with an inherited genetic gene (and a family history of CVD if the person does not have a risk factor)\n- If the patient also has other risk factors or has diabetes or high triglycerides, such as\n- People with CCV with diabetes and triglycerides: Risk factors include hypertension, and diabetes or hyperglycemia.\n- People with CCV, or those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, with the following additional risk factors:\n- People who smoke\n- Patients with a family history of CVD\n- Patients with another cardiac or vascular risk factor that increases the likelihood of CVD\n- Individuals with a history of metabolic syndrome who have risk factors for CVD, but the following additional risk factors:\n- Persons with a history of hypertension (HTN), high triglycerides, or hyperglycemia, but a known family history, or a condition that triggers an event (such as pregnancy)\n- If one or more of the following criteria apply"]}
